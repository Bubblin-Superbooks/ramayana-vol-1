E'en as himself more fair arrayed
In some clear mirror's face displayed.
The aged monarch gazed awhile,
Then thus addressed him with a smile,
As Kaśyap, whom the worlds revere,
Speaks for the Lord of Gods to hear:

In virtue best, thy father's peer,
Child of my consort first in place,

Both modest art and excellent,
But though thy gifts no counsel</pre></div> </div>
