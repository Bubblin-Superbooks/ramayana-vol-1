Its cooling shade shall throw:
I to the shadow of the bough
And leafy trees will go.
Śatrughna, for wise plans renowned,
Shall still on thee attend;
And Lakshmaṇ, ever faithful found,
Be my familiar friend.

The path of right pursue,
And keep the king we all revere
Still to his promise true.”</code></pre><hr class="section"></div> </div>
