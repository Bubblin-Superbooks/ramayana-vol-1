<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">battle-axe,
The royal host, where'er these came,
Fell as if burnt with ravening flame.
The monarch, famous through the world
Again his fearful weapons hurled,
That made KÃ¡mbojas,  all,
With Yavans, troubled, flee and fall.</code></pre><hr class="section"></div> </div>
