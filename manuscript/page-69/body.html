And ruled his city rich and free,
Like Indra's Amarávatí.

There dwelt a just and happy race
With troops of children blest.

And every townsman might be seen
With earrings, wreath, or chain.
None deigned to feed on broken fare,
And none was false or stingy there.
A piece of gold, the smallest</pre></div> </div>
