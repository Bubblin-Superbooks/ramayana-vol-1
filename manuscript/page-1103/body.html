Who wedded with a Śúdra dame.”
These words the boy could scarcely say,
As tortured by the shaft he lay,
Twisting his helpless body round,

The rankling shaft that pierced him through.
With death's last fear my face he eyed,
And, rich in store of penance, died.”</code></pre><hr class="section"></div> </div>
