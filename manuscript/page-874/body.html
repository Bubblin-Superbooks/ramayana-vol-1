We all will go where R치ma goes.
No Br치hman, scorning thee, will rest
Within the realm thou governest,
But all will fly indignant hence:
So great thy trespass and offence.
I marvel, when thy crime I see,
Earth yawns not quick to swallow thee;
And that the Br치hman saints prepare
No burning scourge thy soul to scare,
With cries of shame to smite thee, bent
Upon our R치ma's banishment.
The Mango tree with axes fell,
And tend instead the Neem tree well,
Still watered with all care the tree
Will never sweet and pleasant be.
Thy mother's faults to thee descend,
And with thy borrowed nature</pre></div> </div>
