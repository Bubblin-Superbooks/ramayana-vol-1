<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">king:
Men's fancy is a fickle thing.
To-day the moon, in order due,
Entered the sign Punarvasu, 
To-morrow, as the wise foretell,
In Pushya's favouring stars will dwell:
Then on the throne shalt thou be placed.
My soul, prophetic, counsels haste:
Thee, O my son, to-morrow I
As Regent Heir will sanctify.
So till the coming night be passed
Do thou and Sítá strictly fast:
From worldly thoughts thy soul refrain,
And couched on holy grass remain.
And let thy trusted lords attend
In careful watch upon their friend,
For, unexpected, check and bar
Our weightiest counsels often</pre></div> </div>
