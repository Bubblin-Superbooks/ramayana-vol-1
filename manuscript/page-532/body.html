While Gods and saints unnumbered praised
RÃ¡ma, the mighty bow who raised.
And Jamadagni's son, o'erawed.
Extolled his name with highest laud,
With reverent steps around him strode,
Then hastened on his airy road.
Far from the sight of all he fled,
And rested on Mahendra's head.</code></pre><hr class="section"></div> </div>
