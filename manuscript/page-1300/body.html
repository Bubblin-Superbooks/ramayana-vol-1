Might harm the holy ground and trees,
Springs might be marred and cots o'erthrown,
So with the priests I came alone.”
“Bring all thy host,” the hermit cried,
And Bharat, to his joy, complied.

Be all my wants this day supplied.
Lord Indra at their head, the three 
Who guard the worlds I call to</pre></div> </div>
