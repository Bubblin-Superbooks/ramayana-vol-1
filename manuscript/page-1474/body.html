<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">peers,—
Still firm, in duty proved,
Firm, as the Lord of Snow uprears
His mountains unremoved.
No queen, for choking sobs and sighs,
Could say her last adieu:
Then Ráma bowed, with flooded eyes,
And to his cot withdrew.</code></pre><hr class="section"></div> </div>
