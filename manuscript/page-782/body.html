â€œNot by my pleading may be stayed
The firm resolve thy soul has made.
My hero, thou wilt go; and none

Will chase mine every grief away.
Thou wilt return, thy duty done,
Thy vows discharged, high glory won;
From filial debt wilt thou be free,
And sweetest joy will come on me.
My son, the will of mighty Fate

If now it drives thee hence to stray
Heedless of me who bid thee stay.
Go, strong of arm, go forth, my</pre></div> </div>
