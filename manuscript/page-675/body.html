<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">here,
Here ready by my side behold
These sacred vessels made of gold,
Which water for the rite contain
From Gang√° and each distant main.
Here for installing I have brought
The seat prescribed of fig-wood wrought,
All kinds of seed and precious scent
And many a gem and ornament;
Grain, sacred grass, the garden's spoil,
Honey and curds and milk and oil;
Eight radiant maids, the best of all
War elephants that feed in stall;
A four-horse car, a bow and sword.
A litter, men to bear their lord;
A white umbrella bright and fair
That with the moon may well compare;
Two chouries of the whitest</pre></div> </div>
