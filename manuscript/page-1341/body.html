Round islets here the currents whirl,
And perfect saints from middle air
Are flocking to the waters there.

Exulting with their joyful cries:
Hark, darling, wafted from afar
How soft their pleasant voices are.

To look upon this lovely rill,
To bend mine eyes on thee, dear wife,
Is sweeter than my city life.
Come, bathe we in the pleasant rill
Whose dancing waves are never</pre></div> </div>
