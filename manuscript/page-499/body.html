Thus are we brothers, Saint most high
The younger he, the elder I.
Now, mighty Sage, my spirit joys
To give these maidens to the boys.
Let Sítá be to Ráma tied.
And Urmilá be Lakshmaṇ's bride.
First give, O King, the gift of cows,
As dowry of each royal spouse,
Due offerings to the spirits pay,
And solemnize the wedding-day.
The moon tonight, O royal Sage,
In Maghá's  House takes harbourage;
On the third night his rays benign
In second Phálguni  will shine:
Be that the day, with prosperous fate,
The nuptial rites to celebrate.”</code></pre><hr class="section"></div> </div>
