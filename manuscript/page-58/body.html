<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">bring,
And one a sacrificial string:
One, a clay pitcher from his hoard,
And one, a twisted munja cord. 
One in his joy an axe would find,
One braid, their plaited locks to bind.
One gave a sacrificial cup,
One rope to tie their fagots up;
While fuel at their feet was laid,
Or hermit's stool of fig-tree made.
All gave, or if they gave not, none
Forgot at least a benison.
Some saints, delighted with their lays,
Would promise health and length of days;
Others with surest words would add
Some boon to make their spirit glad.
In such degree of honour then
That song was held by holy</pre></div> </div>
