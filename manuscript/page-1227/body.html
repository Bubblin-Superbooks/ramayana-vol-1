Haled in his rage the wretch along:
Where Queen Kaikeyí dwelt he came,
And sternly then addressed the dame.
Deep in her heart Kaikeyí felt
The stabs his keen reproaches dealt,
And of Śatrughna's ire afraid,

With burning rage, and thus exclaimed:

Would hate the impious matricide:
And if he knew thy vengeful blade
Had slaughtered e'en this hump-back</pre></div> </div>
