Their brows lie trodden on the ground.
North Kuru's realm is fair to see,
Vasvaukasárá, 
But rich in fruit and blossom still
More fair is Chitrakúṭa's hill.
Here shall the years appointed glide
With thee, my beauty, by my side,
And Lakshmaṇ ever near;
Here shall I live in all delight,
Make my ancestral fame more bright,
Tread in their path who walk aright,
And to my oath adhere.”</code></pre><hr class="section"></div> </div>
