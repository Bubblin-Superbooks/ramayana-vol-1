<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">heir,
Of lofty soul and wisdom rare,
Reclining with his Sítá there
Beside the river lay—
He who no troubles e'er had seen,
Whose life a life of bliss had been—
That night beneath the branches green
Passed pleasantly away.</code></pre><hr class="section"></div> </div>
