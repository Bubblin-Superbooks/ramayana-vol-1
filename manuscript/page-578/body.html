My second self thou, Lakshmaṇ, art,
And in my fortune bearest part.
Be thine, Sumitrá's son, to know
The joys from regal power that flow.
My life itself, the monarch's seat,
For thy dear sake to me are sweet.”
Thus Ráma to his brother said,
To both his mothers  bowed his head,
And then with Sítá by his side
To his own house the hero hied.</code></pre><hr class="section"></div> </div>
