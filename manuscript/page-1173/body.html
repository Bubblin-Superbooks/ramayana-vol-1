“How many nights have fled, since thou
Leftest thy grandsire's home, till now?
By flying steeds so swiftly borne,

How fares the king my father, tell:
Is Yudhájit thine uncle well?
And now, my son, at length declare

Since from my grandsire's home I sped:
My mother's sire is well, and he,
Yudhájit, from all trouble free.
The gold and every precious</pre></div> </div>
