<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">bed,
A maiden fair and tender-eyed,
In the young flush of beauty's pride.
She shone with pearl and golden sheen,
And seals of glory stamped her queen,
On each round arm glowed many a gem,
On her smooth brows, a diadem.
Rolling in waves beneath her crown
The glory of her hair flowed down,
Pearls on her neck of price untold,
The lady shone like burnisht gold.
Queen of the Gods, she leapt to land,
A lotus in her perfect hand,
And fondly, of the lotus-sprung,
To lotus-bearing Vishá¹‡u clung.
Her Gods above and men below
As Beauty's Queen and Fortune know. 
Gods, Titans, and the minstrel</pre></div> </div>
