Then say what thou wouldst have me do,
That thou hast sought this interview.
Favoured by thee, my wish is still,
O Hermit, to perform thy will.
Nor needest thou at length explain
The object that thy heart would gain.

My deity, O Lord, art thou.‚Äù

With highest fame and virtue crowned,
Rejoiced these modest words to hear
Delightful to the mind and ear.</code></pre><hr class="section"></div> </div>
