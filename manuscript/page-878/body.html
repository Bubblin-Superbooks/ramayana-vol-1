The king to tread on duty's law.
The lord who all the world sustains,
Bright as the God o'er Gods who reigns.
Our glorious king, by sin unstained,
Will never grant what fraud obtained;
No shade of fault in him is seen:
Let R치ma be anointed, Queen.
Remember, Queen, undying shame
Will through the world pursue thy name,
If R치ma leave the king his sire,
And, banished, to the wood retire.
Come, from thy breast this fever fling:
Of his own realm be R치ma king.
None in this city e'er can dwell
To tend and love thee half so well.
When R치ma sits in royal place,
True to the custom of his</pre></div> </div>
