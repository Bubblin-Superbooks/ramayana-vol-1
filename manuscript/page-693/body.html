<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">decked,
Through crowded halls that rock-like rose,
Or as proud hills where clouds repose,
Sumantra sped uncheckedâ€”
Halls like the glittering domes on high
Reared for the dwellers of the sky
By heavenly architect.</code></pre><hr class="section"></div> </div>
