“By love and tender pity moved,
Your love for me you well have proved;

Before the high souled chief they bent,
With circling steps around him went,
And then with bitter wailing, they

Of Kośala's delightful ground,
Where grain and riches bless the land,
And people give with liberal hand:
A lovely realm unvexed by</pre></div> </div>
