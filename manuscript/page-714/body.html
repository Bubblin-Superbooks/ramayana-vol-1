He who to me in days gone by
Vouchsafed a boon with honours high,
Dares now, a king, his word regret,
And caitiff-like disowns the debt.
The lord of men his promise gave
To grant the boon that I might crave,
And now a bridge would idly throw
When the dried stream has ceased to flow.

In wrath, or e'en for thy dear sake.
From faith, as well the righteous know,
Our virtue and our merits flow.

Do thou thy father's words fulfil:
Swear that his promise shall not fail,
And I will tell thee all the tale.
Yes, RÃ¡ma, when I hear that</pre></div> </div>
