None, but the holy Vedas knew,
And all their six-fold science  too.
No Bráhman there was found unfit
To speak with eloquence and wit.
And now the appointed time came near
The sacrificial posts to rear.
They brought them, and prepared to fix
Of Bel  six and six;
Six, made of the Paláśa  tree,
Of Fig-wood one, apart to be:
Of Sleshmát 
One column each, the mightiest far:
So thick the two, the arms of man
Their ample girth would fail to span.
All these with utmost care were wrought
By hand of priests in Scripture taught,
And all with gold were gilded</pre></div> </div>
