And Mrigas spotted black and white,
And Bhadras of unwearied might,
And Mandras hard to tame. 
Thus, worthy of the name she bore, 
Ayodhyá for a league or more
Cast a bright glory round,
Where Daśaratha wise and great
Governed his fair ancestral state,
With every virtue crowned.
Like Indra in the skies he reigned
In that good town whose wall contained
High domes and turrets proud,
With gates and arcs of triumph decked,
And sturdy barriers to protect
Her gay and countless crowd.</code></pre><hr class="section"></div> </div>
