<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">thou,
But all, alas! is altered now.
What terror can have seized thy breast
To make thee frame this dire request,
That Bharat o'er the land may reign,
And R치ma in the woods remain?
Turn from thine evil ways, O turn,
And thy perfidious counsel spurn,
If thou would fain a favour do
To people, lord, and Bharat too.
O wicked traitress, fierce and vile,
Who lovest deeds of sin and guile,
What crime or grievance dost thou see,
What fault in R치ma or in me?
Thy son will ne'er the throne accept
If R치ma from his rights be kept,
For Bharat's heart more firmly yet
Than R치ma's is on justice</pre></div> </div>
