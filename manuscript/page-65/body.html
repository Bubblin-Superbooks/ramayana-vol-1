There gilded chariots gleam and shine,
And stately piles the Gods enshrine.
There gay sleek people ever throng
To festival and dance and song.

And fragrant with the chaplet's scent
With holy oil and incense blent.

With envoys sent by distant kings,
And merchants with their precious things
With banners o'er her roofs that play,
And weapons that a hundred slay; 
All warlike engines framed by</pre></div> </div>
