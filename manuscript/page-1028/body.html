The best of fair Videha's kings;
Through lonely wilds, a faultless dame,
To this pure grove with me she came.

Where lives of hermits we may lead,
And upon fruits and berries feed.”

And honour-gifts in dishes full,
And drink and food of varied taste,
Berries and roots, before him</pre></div> </div>
