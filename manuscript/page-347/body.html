A reverential minister.
Wood, water, fire, and grass he brought,
Sweet roots and woodland fruit he sought,
And all her wants, the Thousand-eyed,
With never-failing care, supplied,
With tender love and soft caress
Removing pain and weariness.

But ten short years of toil and pain;
These years of penance soon will flee,
And a new brother thou shalt see.

And lust of war his soul shall</pre></div> </div>
