Heeding the bounds of good and ill,
My settled course will I pursue,
Firm in my faith and ever true.
Here in this wild and far retreat

His rank o'er Gods for Indra bought,
And mighty saints their heaven secured
By torturing years on earth endured.”

And thus he spake once more,
Chiding, the while his bosom burned,
Jáváli's impious lore:
“Justice, and courage ne'er dismayed,
Pity for all</pre></div> </div>
