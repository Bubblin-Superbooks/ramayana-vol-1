Was guilty of an impious crime
That marked the lord of each fair flood
As one who spills a Bráhman's blood.” 
Thus spake the queen, and wept, and sighed:

“I have no power to slight or break
Commandments which my father spake.
I bend my head, dear lady, low,
Forgive me, for I needs must go.
Once Kaṇdu, mighty saint, who made
His dwelling in the forest shade,
A cow—and duty's claims he knew—
Obedient to his father, slew.
And in the line from which we spring,
When ordered by their sire the king,
Through earth the sons of Sagar cleft,
And countless things of life bereft.</pre></div> </div>
