And in his noble chariot borne
Drove forward at a rapid pace
Eager to look on Ráma's face.

In sun-bright chariots led the way.

Nine thousand elephants streamed along.
Then sixty thousand cars, and then,
With various arms, came fighting men.

In lengthened line the steeds they rode—
A mighty host, the march to grace
Of Bharat, pride of Raghu's race.

And good Kauśalyá, dear to</pre></div> </div>
