Then weeping, faint, with loud lament,
Down Sarj√∫'s shelving bank they went.
There standing on the river side
With Bharat, priest, and peer,
Their lips the women purified
With water fresh and clear.
Returning to the royal town,
Their eyes with tear-drops filled,
Ten days on earth they laid them down,
And wept till grief was stilled.</code></pre><hr class="section"></div> </div>
