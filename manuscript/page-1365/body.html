To bend the bow or lift the shield,
If Bharat brave, and wise, and good,

And if I now my brother slew
What gain in kingship should I find,
Despised and scorned by all mankind?

From poisoned meat or deadly drink,
No power or treasure would I win
By fall of friend or kith or kin.
Brother, believe the words I speak:
For your dear sakes alone I</pre></div> </div>
