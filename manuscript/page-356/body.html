Close, in the city's neighbourhood,
O'ergrown, deserted, marked by age,
And thus addressed the mighty sage:
“O reverend lord. I long to know
What hermit dwelt here long ago.”
Then to the prince his holy guide,
Most eloquent of men, replied:
“O Ráma, listen while I tell

Like heaven itself, most honoured by
The Gods who dwell above the sky.

His fervid task the ascetic</pre></div> </div>
