Herald and bard who rightly knew
Each nice degree of honour due,
Their loud auspicious voices raised,
And royal Bharat blessed and praised.
With sticks of gold the drum they smote,
Which thundered out its deafening note,
Blew loud the sounding shell, and blent
Each high and low-toned instrument.

Through all the air was quickly borne,
And as in Bharat's ear it rang,
Gave the sad prince another pang.

Stilled the glad sounds that round him</pre></div> </div>
