first and best\nOf hermit saints, these words addressed: \n“In all this world, I pray thee, who\nIs virtuous, heroic, true?\nFirm in his vows, of grateful mind,\nTo every creature good and kind?\nBounteous, and holy, just, and wise,\nAlone most fair to all men's eyes?\nDevoid of envy, firm, and sage,\nWhose tranquil soul ne'er yields to rage?\nWhom, when his warrior wrath is high,\nDo Gods embattled fear and fly?\nWhose noble might and gentle skill\nThe triple world can guard from ill?\nWho is the best of princes, he\nWho loves his people's good to see?\nThe store of bliss, the living mine\nWhere brightest joys and virtues shine?\nQueen Fortune's  best and dearest friend,\nWhose steps her choicest gifts attend?\nWho may with Sun and Moon compare,\nWith Indra,  Fire, and Air?\nGrant, Saint divine,  the boon I ask,\nFor thee, I ween, an easy task,\nTo whom the power is given to know\nIf such a man breathe here below.”\nThen Nárad, clear before whose eye\nThe present, past, and future lie, \nMade ready answer: “Hermit, where\nAre graces found so high and rare?\nYet listen, and my tongue shall tell\nIn whom alone these virtues dwell.\nFrom old Ikshváku's  line he came,\nKnown to the world by Ráma's name:\nWith soul subdued, a chief of might,\nIn Scripture versed, in glory bright,\nHis steps in virtue's paths are bent,\nObedient, pure, and eloquent.\nIn each emprise he wins success,\nAnd dying foes his power confess.\nTall and broad-shouldered, strong of limb,\nFortune has set her mark on him.\nGraced with a conch-shell's triple line,\nHis throat displays the auspicious sign. \nHigh destiny is clear impressed\nOn massive jaw and ample chest,\nHis mighty shafts he truly aims,\nAnd foemen in the battle tames.\nDeep in the muscle, scarcely shown,\nEmbedded lies his collar-bone.\nHis lordly steps are firm and free,\nHis strong arms reach below his knee; \nAll fairest graces join to deck\nHis head, his brow, his stately neck,\nAnd limbs in fair proportion set:\nThe manliest form e'er fashioned yet.\nGraced with each high imperial mark,\nHis skin is soft and lustrous dark.\nLarge are his eyes that sweetly shine\nWith majesty almost divine.\nHis plighted word he ne'er forgets;\nOn erring sense a watch he sets.\nBy nature wise, his teacher's skill\nHas trained him to subdue his will.\nGood, resolute and pure, and strong,\nHe guards mankind from scathe and wrong,\nAnd lends his aid, and ne'er in vain,\nThe cause of justice to maintain.\nWell has he studied o'er and o'er\nThe Vedas and their kindred lore.\nWell skilled is he the bow to draw, \nWell trained in arts and versed in law;\nHigh-souled and meet for happy fate,\nMost tender and compassionate;\nThe noblest of all lordly givers,\nWhom good men follow, as the rivers\nFollow the King of Floods, the sea:\nSo liberal, so just is he.\nThe joy of Queen Kauśalyá's heart,\nIn every virtue he has part:\nFirm as Himálaya's  snowy steep,\nUnfathomed like the mighty deep:\nThe peer of Vishṇu's power and might,\nAnd lovely as the Lord of Night; \nPatient as Earth, but, roused to ire,\nFierce as the world-destroying fire;\nIn bounty like the Lord of Gold, \nAnd Justice self in human mould.\nWith him, his best and eldest son,\nBy all his princely virtues won\nKing Daśaratha  willed to share\nHis kingdom as the Regent Heir.\nBut when Kaikeyí, youngest queen,\nWith eyes of envious hate had seen\nThe solemn pomp and regal state\nPrepared the prince to consecrate,\nShe bade the hapless king bestow\nTwo gifts he promised long ago,\nThat Ráma to the woods should flee,\nAnd that her child the heir should be.\nBy chains of duty firmly tied,\nThe wretched king perforce complied.\nRáma, to please Kaikeyí went\nObedient forth to banishment.\nThen Lakshmaṇ's truth was nobly shown,\nThen were his love and courage known,\nWhen for his brother's sake he dared\nAll perils, and his exile shared.\nAnd Sítá, Ráma's darling wife,\nLoved even as he loved his life,\nWhom happy marks combined to bless,\nA miracle of loveliness,\nOf Janak's royal lineage sprung,\nMost excellent of women, clung\nTo her dear lord, like Rohiṇí\nRejoicing with the Moon to be. \nThe King and people, sad of mood,\nThe hero's car awhile pursued.\nBut when Prince Ráma lighted down\nAt Śringavera's pleasant town,\nWhere Gangá's holy waters flow,\nHe bade his driver turn and go.\nGuha, Nishádas' king, he met,\nAnd on the farther bank was set.\nThen on from wood to wood they strayed,\nO'er many a stream, through constant shade,\nAs Bharadvája bade them, till\nThey came to Chitrakúṭa's hill.\nAnd Ráma there, with Lakshmaṇ's aid,\nA pleasant little cottage made,\nAnd spent his days with Sítá, dressed\nIn coat of bark and deerskin vest. \nAnd Chitrakúṭa grew to be\nAs bright with those illustrious three\nAs Meru's  sacred peaks that shine\nWith glory, when the Gods recline\nBeneath them: Śiva's  self between\nThe Lord of Gold and Beauty's Queen.\nThe aged king for Ráma pined,\nAnd for the skies the earth resigned.\nBharat, his son, refused to reign,\nThough urged by all the twice-born  train.\nForth to the woods he fared to meet\nHis brother, fell before his feet,\nAnd cried, “Thy claim all men allow:\nO come, our lord and king be thou.”\nBut Ráma nobly chose to be\nObservant of his sire's decree.\nHe placed his sandals  in his hand\nA pledge that he would rule the land:\nAnd bade his brother turn again.\nThen Bharat, finding prayer was vain,\nThe sandals took and went away;\nNor in Ayodhyá would he stay.\nBut turned to Nandigráma, where\nHe ruled the realm with watchful care,\nStill longing eagerly to learn\nTidings of Ráma's safe return.\nThen lest the people should repeat\nTheir visit to his calm retreat,\nAway from Chitrakúṭa's hill\nFared Ráma ever onward till\nBeneath the shady trees he stood\nOf Daṇḍaká's primeval wood,\nVirádha, giant fiend, he slew,\nAnd then Agastya's friendship knew.\nCounselled by him he gained the sword\nAnd bow of Indra, heavenly lord:\nA pair of quivers too, that bore\nOf arrows an exhaustless store.\nWhile there he dwelt in greenwood shade\nThe trembling hermits sought his aid,\nAnd bade him with his sword and bow\nDestroy the fiends who worked them woe:\nTo come like Indra strong and brave,\nA guardian God to help and save.\nAnd Ráma's falchion left its trace\nDeep cut on Śúrpaṇakhá's face:\nA hideous giantess who came\nBurning for him with lawless flame.\nTheir sister's cries the giants heard.\nAnd vengeance in each bosom stirred:\nThe monster of the triple head.\nAnd Dúshaṇ to the contest sped.\nBut they and myriad fiends beside\nBeneath the might of Ráma died.\nWhen Rávaṇ, dreaded warrior, knew\nThe slaughter of his giant crew:\nRávaṇ, the king, whose name of fear\nEarth, hell, and heaven all shook to hear:\nHe bade the fiend Márícha aid\nThe vengeful plot his fury laid.\nIn vain the wise Márícha tried\nTo turn him from his course aside:\nNot Rávaṇ's self, he said, might hope\nWith Ráma and his strength to cope.\nImpelled by fate and blind with rage\nHe came to Ráma's hermitage.\nThere, by Márícha's magic art,\nHe wiled the princely youths apart,\nThe vulture  slew, and bore away\nThe wife of Ráma as his prey.\nThe son of Raghu  came and found\nJaṭáyu slain upon the ground.\nHe rushed within his leafy cot;\nHe sought his wife, but found her not.\nThen, then the hero's senses failed;\nIn mad despair he wept and wailed.\nUpon the pile that bird he laid,\nAnd still in quest of Sítá strayed.\nA hideous giant then he saw,\nKabandha named, a shape of awe.\nThe monstrous fiend he smote and slew,\nAnd in the flame the body threw;\nWhen straight from out the funeral flame\nIn lovely form Kabandha came,\nAnd bade him seek in his distress\nA wise and holy hermitess.\nBy counsel of this saintly dame\nTo Pampá's pleasant flood he came,\nAnd there the steadfast friendship won\nOf Hanumán the Wind-God's son.\nCounselled by him he told his grief\nTo great Sugríva, Vánar chief,\nWho, knowing all the tale, before\nThe sacred flame alliance swore.\nSugríva to his new-found friend\nTold his own story to the end:\nHis hate of Báli for the wrong\nAnd insult he had borne so long.\nAnd Ráma lent a willing ear\nAnd promised to allay his fear.\nSugríva warned him of the might\nOf Báli, matchless in the fight,\nAnd, credence for his tale to gain,\nShowed the huge fiend  by Báli slain.\nThe prostrate corse of mountain size\nSeemed nothing in the hero's eyes;\nHe lightly kicked it, as it lay,\nAnd cast it twenty leagues  away.\nTo prove his might his arrows through\nSeven palms in line, uninjured, flew.\nHe cleft a mighty hill apart,\nAnd down to hell he hurled his dart.\nThen high Sugríva's spirit rose,\nAssured of conquest o'er his foes.\nWith his new champion by his side\nTo vast Kishkindhá's cave he hied.\nThen, summoned by his awful shout,\nKing Báli came in fury out,\nFirst comforted his trembling wife,\nThen sought Sugríva in the strife.\nOne shaft from Ráma's deadly bow\nThe monarch in the dust laid low.\nThen Ráma bade Sugríva reign\nIn place of royal Báli slain.\nThen speedy envoys hurried forth\nEastward and westward, south and north,\nCommanded by the grateful king\nTidings of Ráma's spouse to bring.\nThen by Sampáti's counsel led,\nBrave Hanumán, who mocked at dread,\nSprang at one wild tremendous leap\nTwo hundred leagues across the deep.\nTo Lanká's  town he urged his way,\nWhere Rávaṇ held his royal sway.\nThere pensive 'neath Aśoka  boughs\nHe found poor Sítá, Ráma's spouse.\nHe gave the hapless girl a ring,\nA token from her lord and king.\nA pledge from her fair hand he bore;\nThen battered down the garden door.\nFive captains of the host he slew,\nSeven sons of councillors o'erthrew;\nCrushed youthful Aksha on the field,\nThen to his captors chose to yield.\nSoon from their bonds his limbs were free,\nBut honouring the high decree\nWhich Brahmá  had pronounced of yore,\nHe calmly all their insults bore.\nThe town he burnt with hostile flame,\nAnd spoke again with Ráma's dame,\nThen swiftly back to Ráma flew\nWith tidings of the interview.\nThen with Sugríva for his guide,\nCame Ráma to the ocean side.\nHe smote the sea with shafts as bright\nAs sunbeams in their summer height,\nAnd quick appeared the Rivers' King \nObedient to the summoning.\nA bridge was thrown by Nala o'er\nThe narrow sea from shore to shore. \nThey crossed to Lanká's golden town,\nWhere Ráma's hand smote Rávaṇ down.\nVibhishaṇ there was left to reign\nOver his brother's wide domain.\nTo meet her husband Sítá came;\nBut Ráma, stung with ire and shame,\nWith bitter words his wife addressed\nBefore the crowd that round her pressed.\nBut Sítá, touched with noble ire,\nGave her fair body to the fire.\nThen straight the God of Wind appeared,\nAnd words from heaven her honour cleared.\nAnd Ráma clasped his wife again,\nUninjured, pure from spot and stain,\nObedient to the Lord of Fire\nAnd the high mandate of his sire.\nLed by the Lord who rules the sky,\nThe Gods and heavenly saints drew nigh,\nAnd honoured him with worthy meed,\nRejoicing in each glorious deed.\nHis task achieved, his foe removed,\nHe triumphed, by the Gods approved.\nBy grace of Heaven he raised to life\nThe chieftains slain in mortal strife;\nThen in the magic chariot through\nThe clouds to Nandigráma flew.\nMet by his faithful brothers there,\nHe loosed his votive coil of hair:\nThence fair Ayodhyá's town he gained,\nAnd o'er his father's kingdom reigned.\nDisease or famine ne'er oppressed\nHis happy people, richly blest\nWith all the joys of ample wealth,\nOf sweet content and perfect health.\nNo widow mourned her well-loved mate,\nNo sire his son's untimely fate.\nThey feared not storm or robber's hand;\nNo fire or flood laid waste the land:\nThe Golden Age  had come again\nTo bless the days of Ráma's reign.\nFrom him, the great and glorious king,\nShall many a princely scion spring.\nAnd he shall rule, beloved by men,\nTen thousand years and hundreds ten, \nAnd when his life on earth is past\nTo Brahmá's world shall go at last.”\nWhoe'er this noble poem reads\nThat tells the tale of Ráma's deeds,\nGood as the Scriptures, he shall be\nFrom every sin and blemish free.\nWhoever reads the saving strain,\nWith all his kin the heavens shall gain.\nBráhmans who read shall gather hence\nThe highest praise for eloquence.\nThe warrior, o'er the land shall reign,\nThe merchant, luck in trade obtain;\nAnd Śúdras listening  ne'er shall fail\nTo reap advantage from the tale.</code>"

bent\nBefore the saint most eloquent.\nThus honoured and dismissed the seer\nDeparted to his heavenly sphere.\nThen from his cot Válmíki hied\nTo Tamasá's  sequestered side,\nNot far remote from Gangá's tide.\nHe stood and saw the ripples roll\nPellucid o'er a pebbly shoal.\nTo Bharadvája  by his side\nHe turned in ecstasy, and cried:\n“See, pupil dear, this lovely sight,\nThe smooth-floored shallow, pure and bright,\nWith not a speck or shade to mar,\nAnd clear as good men's bosoms are.\nHere on the brink thy pitcher lay,\nAnd bring my zone of bark, I pray.\nHere will I bathe: the rill has not,\nTo lave the limbs, a fairer spot.\nDo quickly as I bid, nor waste\nThe precious time; away, and haste.”\nObedient to his master's hest\nQuick from the cot he brought the vest;\nThe hermit took it from his hand,\nAnd tightened round his waist the band;\nThen duly dipped and bathed him there,\nAnd muttered low his secret prayer.\nTo spirits and to Gods he made\nLibation of the stream, and strayed\nViewing the forest deep and wide\nThat spread its shade on every side.\nClose by the bank he saw a pair\nOf curlews sporting fearless there.\nBut suddenly with evil mind\nAn outcast fowler stole behind,\nAnd, with an aim too sure and true,\nThe male bird near the hermit slew.\nThe wretched hen in wild despair\nWith fluttering pinions beat the air,\nAnd shrieked a long and bitter cry\nWhen low on earth she saw him lie,\nHer loved companion, quivering, dead,\nHis dear wings with his lifeblood red;\nAnd for her golden crested mate\nShe mourned, and was disconsolate.\nThe hermit saw the slaughtered bird,\nAnd all his heart with ruth was stirred.\nThe fowler's impious deed distressed\nHis gentle sympathetic breast,\nAnd while the curlew's sad cries rang\nWithin his ears, the hermit sang:\n“No fame be thine for endless time,\nBecause, base outcast, of thy crime,\nWhose cruel hand was fain to slay\nOne of this gentle pair at play!”\nE'en as he spoke his bosom wrought\nAnd laboured with the wondering thought\nWhat was the speech his ready tongue\nHad uttered when his heart was wrung.\nHe pondered long upon the speech,\nRecalled the words and measured each,\nAnd thus exclaimed the saintly guide\nTo Bharadvája by his side:\n“With equal lines of even feet,\nWith rhythm and time and tone complete,\nThe measured form of words I spoke\nIn shock of grief be termed a śloke.” \nAnd Bharadvája, nothing slow\nHis faithful love and zeal to show,\nAnswered those words of wisdom, “Be\nThe name, my lord, as pleases thee.”\nAs rules prescribe the hermit took\nSome lustral water from the brook.\nBut still on this his constant thought\nKept brooding, as his home he sought;\nWhile Bharadvája paced behind,\nA pupil sage of lowly mind,\nAnd in his hand a pitcher bore\nWith pure fresh water brimming o'er.\nSoon as they reached their calm retreat\nThe holy hermit took his seat;\nHis mind from worldly cares recalled,\nAnd mused in deepest thought enthralled.\nThen glorious Brahmá,  Lord Most High,\nCreator of the earth and sky,\nThe four-faced God, to meet the sage\nCame to Válmíki's hermitage.\nSoon as the mighty God he saw,\nUp sprang the saint in wondering awe.\nMute, with clasped hands, his head he bent,\nAnd stood before him reverent.\nHis honoured guest he greeted well,\nWho bade him of his welfare tell;\nGave water for his blessed feet,\nBrought offerings,  and prepared a seat.\nIn honoured place the God Most High\nSate down, and bade the saint sit nigh.\nThere sate before Válmíki's eyes\nThe Father of the earth and skies;\nBut still the hermit's thoughts were bent\nOn one thing only, all intent\nOn that poor curlew's mournful fate\nLamenting for her slaughtered mate;\nAnd still his lips, in absent mood,\nThe verse that told his grief, renewed:\n“Woe to the fowler's impious hand\nThat did the deed that folly planned;\nThat could to needless death devote\nThe curlew of the tuneful throat!”\nThe heavenly Father smiled in glee,\nAnd said, “O best of hermits, see,\nA verse, unconscious, thou hast made;\nNo longer be the task delayed.\nSeek not to trace, with labour vain,\nThe unpremeditated strain.\nThe tuneful lines thy lips rehearsed\nSpontaneous from thy bosom burst.\nThen come, O best of seers, relate\nThe life of Ráma good and great,\nThe tale that saintly Nárad told,\nIn all its glorious length unfold.\nOf all the deeds his arm has done\nUpon this earth, omit not one,\nAnd thus the noble life record\nOf that wise, brave, and virtuous lord.\nHis every act to day displayed,\nHis secret life to none betrayed:\nHow Lakshmaṇ, how the giants fought;\nWith high emprise and hidden thought:\nAnd all that Janak's child  befell\nWhere all could see, where none could tell.\nThe whole of this shall truly be\nMade known, O best of saints, to thee.\nIn all thy poem, through my grace,\nNo word of falsehood shall have place.\nBegin the story, and rehearse\nThe tale divine in charming verse.\nAs long as in this firm-set land\nThe streams shall flow, the mountains stand,\nSo long throughout the world, be sure,\nThe great Rámáyan shall endure. \nWhile the Rámáyan's ancient strain\nShall glorious in the earth remain,\nTo higher spheres shalt thou arise\nAnd dwell with me above the skies.”\nHe spoke, and vanished into air,\nAnd left Válmíki wondering there.\nThe pupils of the holy man,\nMoved by their love of him, began\nTo chant that verse, and ever more\nThey marvelled as they sang it o'er:\n“Behold, the four-lined balanced rime,\nRepeated over many a time,\nIn words that from the hermit broke\nIn shock of grief, becomes a śloke.”\nThis measure now Válmíki chose\nWherein his story to compose.\nIn hundreds of such verses, sweet\nWith equal lines and even feet,\nThe saintly poet, lofty-souled,\nThe glorious deeds of Ráma told.</code>"

The tuneful pair,\nLike heavenly minstrels sweet and fair,\nIn music's art divinely skilled,\nTheir saintly master's word fulfilled.\nLike Ráma's self, from whom they came,\nThey showed their sire in face and frame,\nAs though from some fair sculptured stone\nTwo selfsame images had grown.\nSometimes the pair rose up to sing,\nSurrounded by a holy ring,\nWhere seated on the grass had met\nFull many a musing anchoret.\nThen tears bedimmed those gentle eyes,\nAs transport took them and surprise,\nAnd as they listened every one\nCried in delight, Well done! Well done!\nThose sages versed in holy lore\nPraised the sweet minstrels more and more:\nAnd wondered at the singers' skill,\nAnd the bard's verses sweeter still,\nWhich laid so clear before the eye\nThe glorious deeds of days gone by.\nThus by the virtuous hermits praised,\nInspirited their voice they raised.\nPleased with the song this holy man\nWould give the youths a water-can;\nOne gave a fair ascetic dress,\nOr sweet fruit from the wilderness.\nOne saint a black-deer's hide would bring,\nAnd one a sacrificial string:\nOne, a clay pitcher from his hoard,\nAnd one, a twisted munja cord. \nOne in his joy an axe would find,\nOne braid, their plaited locks to bind.\nOne gave a sacrificial cup,\nOne rope to tie their fagots up;\nWhile fuel at their feet was laid,\nOr hermit's stool of fig-tree made.\nAll gave, or if they gave not, none\nForgot at least a benison.\nSome saints, delighted with their lays,\nWould promise health and length of days;\nOthers with surest words would add\nSome boon to make their spirit glad.\nIn such degree of honour then\nThat song was held by holy men:\nThat living song which life can give,\nBy which shall many a minstrel live.\nIn seat of kings, in crowded hall,\nThey sang the poem, praised of all.\nAnd Ráma chanced to hear their lay,\nWhile he the votive steed  would slay,\nAnd sent fit messengers to bring\nThe minstrel pair before the king.\nThey came, and found the monarch high\nEnthroned in gold, his brothers nigh;\nWhile many a minister below,\nAnd noble, sate in lengthened row.\nThe youthful pair awhile he viewed\nGraceful in modest attitude,\nAnd then in words like these addressed\nHis brother Lakshmaṇ and the rest:\n“Come, listen to the wondrous strain\nRecited by these godlike twain,\nSweet singers of a story fraught\nWith melody and lofty thought.”\nThe pair, with voices sweet and strong,\nRolled the full tide of noble song,\nWith tone and accent deftly blent\nTo suit the changing argument.\nMid that assembly loud and clear\nRang forth that lay so sweet to hear,\nThat universal rapture stole\nThrough each man's frame and heart and soul.\n“These minstrels, blest with every sign\nThat marks a high and princely line,\nIn holy shades who dwell,\nEnshrined in Saint Válmíki's lay,\nA monument to live for aye,\nMy deeds in song shall tell.”\nThus Ráma spoke: their breasts were fired,\nAnd the great tale, as if inspired,\nThe youths began to sing,\nWhile every heart with transport swelled,\nAnd mute and rapt attention held\nThe concourse and the king.</code>"

We pray thee, tell,\nWe wish to know thee, gentle youth;\nCome, tell us, if thou wilt, the truth.”\nHe gazed upon that sight he ne'er\nHad seen before, of girls so fair,\nAnd out of love a longing rose\nHis sire and lineage to disclose:\n“My father,” thus he made reply,\n“Is Kaśyap's son, a saint most high,\nVibháṇdak styled; from him I came,\nAnd Rishyaśring he calls my name.\nOur hermit cot is near this place:\nCome thither, O ye fair of face;\nThere be it mine, with honour due,\nYe gentle youths, to welcome you.”\nThey heard his speech, and gave consent,\nAnd gladly to his cottage went.\nVibháṇdak's son received them well\nBeneath the shelter of his cell\nWith guest-gift, water for their feet,\nAnd woodland fruit and roots to eat,\nThey smiled, and spoke sweet words like these,\nDelighted with his courtesies:\n“We too have goodly fruit in store,\nGrown on the trees that shade our door;\nCome, if thou wilt, kind Hermit, haste\nThe produce of our grove to taste;\nAnd let, O good Ascetic, first\nThis holy water quench thy thirst.”\nThey spoke, and gave him comfits sweet\nPrepared ripe fruits to counterfeit;\nAnd many a dainty cate beside\nAnd luscious mead their stores supplied.\nThe seeming fruits, in taste and look,\nThe unsuspecting hermit took,\nFor, strange to him, their form beguiled\nThe dweller in the lonely wild.\nThen round his neck fair arms were flung,\nAnd there the laughing damsels clung,\nAnd pressing nearer and more near\nWith sweet lips whispered at his ear;\nWhile rounded limb and swelling breast\nThe youthful hermit softly pressed.\nThe pleasing charm of that strange bowl,\nThe touch of a tender limb,\nOver his yielding spirit stole\nAnd sweetly vanquished him.\nBut vows, they said, must now be paid;\nThey bade the boy farewell,\nAnd, of the aged saint afraid,\nPrepared to leave the dell.\nWith ready guile they told him where\nTheir hermit dwelling lay:\nThen, lest the sire should find them there,\nSped by wild paths away.\nThey fled and left him there alone\nBy longing love possessed;\nAnd with a heart no more his own\nHe roamed about distressed.\nThe aged saint came home, to find\nThe hermit boy distraught,\nRevolving in his troubled mind\nOne solitary thought.\n“Why dost thou not, my son,” he cried,\n“Thy due obeisance pay?\nWhy do I see thee in the tide\nOf whelming thought to-day?\nA devotee should never wear\nA mien so sad and strange.\nCome, quickly, dearest child, declare\nThe reason of the change.”\nAnd Rishyaśring, when questioned thus,\nMade answer in this wise:\n“O sire, there came to visit us\nSome men with lovely eyes.\nAbout my neck soft arms they wound\nAnd kept me tightly held\nTo tender breasts so soft and round,\nThat strangely heaved and swelled.\nThey sing more sweetly as they dance\nThan e'er I heard till now,\nAnd play with many a sidelong glance\nAnd arching of the brow.”\n“My son,” said he, “thus giants roam\nWhere holy hermits are,\nAnd wander round their peaceful home\nTheir rites austere to mar.\nI charge thee, thou must never lay\nThy trust in them, dear boy:\nThey seek thee only to betray,\nAnd woo but to destroy.”\nThus having warned him of his foes\nThat night at home he spent.\nAnd when the morrow's sun arose\nForth to the forest went.\nBut Rishyaśring with eager pace\nSped forth and hurried to the place\nWhere he those visitants had seen\nOf daintly waist and charming mien.\nWhen from afar they saw the son\nOf Saint Vibháṇdak toward them run,\nTo meet the hermit boy they hied,\nAnd hailed him with a smile, and cried:\n“O come, we pray, dear lord, behold\nOur lovely home of which we told\nDue honour there to thee we'll pay,\nAnd speed thee on thy homeward way.”\nPleased with the gracious words they said\nHe followed where the damsels led.\nAs with his guides his steps he bent,\nThat Bráhman high of worth,\nA flood of rain from heaven was sent\nThat gladdened all the earth.\nVibháṇdak took his homeward road,\nAnd wearied by the heavy load\nOf roots and woodland fruit he bore\nEntered at last his cottage door.\nFain for his son he looked around,\nBut desolate the cell he found.\nHe stayed not then to bathe his feet,\nThough fainting with the toil and heat,\nBut hurried forth and roamed about\nCalling the boy with cry and shout,\nHe searched the wood, but all in vain;\nNor tidings of his son could gain.\nOne day beyond the forest's bound\nThe wandering saint a village found,\nAnd asked the swains and neatherds there\nWho owned the land so rich and fair,\nWith all the hamlets of the plain,\nAnd herds of kine and fields of grain.\nThey listened to the hermit's words,\nAnd all the guardians of the herds,\nWith suppliant hands together pressed,\nThis answer to the saint addressed:\n“The Angas' lord who bears the name\nOf Lomapád, renowned by fame,\nBestowed these hamlets with their kine\nAnd all their riches, as a sign\nOf grace, on Rishyaśring: and he\nVibháṇdak's son is said to be.”\nThe hermit with exulting breast\nThe mighty will of fate confessed,\nBy meditation's eye discerned;\nAnd cheerful to his home returned.\nA stately ship, at early morn,\nThe hermit's son away had borne.\nLoud roared the clouds, as on he sped,\nThe sky grew blacker overhead;\nTill, as he reached the royal town,\nA mighty flood of rain came down.\nBy the great rain the monarch's mind\nThe coming of his guest divined.\nTo meet the honoured youth he went,\nAnd low to earth his head he bent.\nWith his own priest to lead the train,\nHe gave the gift high guests obtain.\nAnd sought, with all who dwelt within\nThe city walls, his grace to win.\nHe fed him with the daintiest fare,\nHe served him with unceasing care,\nAnd ministered with anxious eyes\nLest anger in his breast should rise;\nAnd gave to be the Bráhman's bride\nHis own fair daughter, lotus-eyed.\nThus loved and honoured by the king,\nThe glorious Bráhman Rishyaśring\nPassed in that royal town his life\nWith Śántá his beloved wife.”</code>"

modest words this speech began:\n“Prepare the rite with all things fit\nAs is ordained in Holy Writ,\nAnd keep with utmost care afar\nWhate'er its sacred forms might mar.\nThou art, my lord, my trustiest guide,\nKind-hearted, and my friend beside;\nSo is it meet thou undertake\nThis heavy task for duty's sake.”\nThen he, of twice-born men the best,\nHis glad assent at once expressed:\n“Fain will I do whate'er may be\nDesired, O honoured King, by thee.”\nTo ancient priests he spoke, who, trained\nIn holy rites, deep skill had gained:\n“Here guards be stationed, good and sage\nReligious men of trusted age.\nAnd various workmen send and call,\nWho frame the door and build the wall:\nWith men of every art and trade,\nWho read the stars and ply the spade,\nAnd mimes and minstrels hither bring,\nAnd damsels trained to dance and sing.”\nThen to the learned men he said,\nIn many a page of Scripture read:\n“Be yours each rite performed to see\nAccording to the king's decree.\nAnd stranger Bráhmans quickly call\nTo this great rite that welcomes all.\nPavilions for the princes, decked\nWith art and ornament, erect,\nAnd handsome booths by thousands made\nThe Bráhman visitors to shade,\nArranged in order side by side,\nWith meat and drink and all supplied.\nAnd ample stables we shall need\nFor many an elephant and steed:\nAnd chambers where the men may lie,\nAnd vast apartments, broad and high,\nFit to receive the countless bands\nOf warriors come from distant lands.\nFor our own people too provide\nSufficient tents, extended wide,\nAnd stores of meat and drink prepare,\nAnd all that can be needed there.\nAnd food in plenty must be found\nFor guests from all the country round.\nOf various viands presents make,\nFor honour, not for pity's sake,\nThat fit regard and worship be\nPaid to each caste in due degree.\nAnd let not wish or wrath excite\nYour hearts the meanest guest to slight;\nBut still observe with special grace\nThose who obtain the foremost place,\nWhether for happier skill in art\nOr bearing in the rite their part.\nDo you, I pray, with friendly mind\nPerform the task to you assigned,\nAnd work the rite, as bids the law,\nWithout omission, slip, or flaw”\nThey answered: “As thou seest fit\nSo will we do and naught omit.”\nThe sage Vaśiṣṭha then addressed\nSumantra called at his behest:\n“The princes of the earth invite,\nAnd famous lords who guard the rite,\nPriest, Warrior, Merchant, lowly thrall,\nIn countless thousands summon all.\nWhere'er their home be, far or near,\nGather the good with honour here,\nAnd Janak, whose imperial sway\nThe men of Míthilá  obey.\nThe firm of vow, the dread of foes,\nWho all the lore of Scripture knows,\nInvite him here with honour high,\nKing Daśaratha's old ally.\nAnd Káśi's  lord of gentle speech,\nWho finds a pleasant word for each,\nIn length of days our monarch's peer,\nIllustrious king, invite him here.\nThe father of our ruler's bride,\nKnown for his virtues far and wide,\nThe king whom Kekaya's  realms obey,\nHim with his son invite, I pray.\nAnd Lomapád the Angas' king,\nTrue to his vows and godlike, bring.\nFor be thine invitations sent\nTo west and south and orient.\nCall those who rule Suráshṭra's  land,\nSuvíra's  realm and Sindhu's strand,\nAnd all the kings of earth beside\nIn friendship's bonds with us allied:\nInvite them all to hasten in\nWith retinue and kith and kin.”\nVaśishṭha's speech without delay\nSumantra bent him to obey.\nAnd sent his trusty envoys forth\nEastward and westward, south and north.\nObedient to the saint's request\nHimself he hurried forth, and pressed\nEach nobler chief and lord and king\nTo hasten to the gathering.\nBefore the saint Vaśishṭha stood\nAll those who wrought with stone and wood,\nAnd showed the work which every one\nIn furtherance of the rite had done,\nRejoiced their ready zeal to see,\nThus to the craftsmen all said he:\n“I charge ye, masters, see to this,\nThat there be nothing done amiss,\nAnd this, I pray, in mind be borne,\nThat not one gift ye give in scorn:\nWhenever scorn a gift attends\nGreat sin is his who thus offends.”\nAnd now some days and nights had past,\nAnd kings began to gather fast,\nAnd precious gems in liberal store\nAs gifts to Daśaratha bore.\nThen joy thrilled through Vaśishṭha's breast\nAs thus the monarch he addressed:\n“Obedient to thy high decree\nThe kings, my lord, are come to thee.\nAnd it has been my care to greet\nAnd honour all with reverence meet.\nThy servants' task is ended quite,\nAnd all is ready for the rite.\nCome forth then to the sacred ground\nWhere all in order will be found.”\nThen Rishyaśring confirmed the tale:\nNor did their words to move him fail.\nThe stars propitious influence lent\nWhen forth the world's great ruler went.\nThen by the sage Vaśishṭha led\nThe priest begun to speed\nThose glorious rites wherein is shed\nThe lifeblood of the steed.</code>"

No beast\nWas there that lacked an ample feast.\nFor there was store for all who came,\nFor orphan child and lonely dame;\nThe old and young were well supplied,\nThe poor and hungry satisfied.\nThroughout the day ascetics fed,\nAnd those who roam to beg their bread:\nWhile all around the cry was still,\n“Give forth, give forth,” and “Eat your fill.”\n“Give forth with liberal hand the meal,\nAnd various robes in largess deal.”\nUrged by these cries on every side\nUnweariedly their task they plied:\nAnd heaps of food like hills in size\nIn boundless plenty met the eyes:\nAnd lakes of sauce, each day renewed,\nRefreshed the weary multitude.\nAnd strangers there from distant lands,\nAnd women folk in crowded bands\nThe best of food and drink obtained\nAt the great rite the king ordained.\nApart from all, the Bráhmans there,\nThousands on thousands, took their share\nOf various dainties sweet to taste,\nOn plates of gold and silver placed,\nAll ready set, as, when they willed,\nThe twice-born men their places filled.\nAnd servants in fair garments dressed\nWaited upon each Bráhman guest.\nOf cheerful mind and mien were they,\nWith gold and jewelled earrings gay.\nThe best of Bráhmans praised the fare\nOf countless sorts, of flavour rare:\nAnd thus to Raghu's son they cried:\n“We bless thee, and are satisfied.”\nBetween the rites some Bráhmans spent\nThe time in learned argument,\nWith ready flow of speech, sedate,\nAnd keen to vanquish in debate. \nThere day by day the holy train\nPerformed all rites as rules ordain.\nNo priest in all that host was found\nBut kept the vows that held him bound:\nNone, but the holy Vedas knew,\nAnd all their six-fold science  too.\nNo Bráhman there was found unfit\nTo speak with eloquence and wit.\nAnd now the appointed time came near\nThe sacrificial posts to rear.\nThey brought them, and prepared to fix\nOf Bel  six and six;\nSix, made of the Paláśa  tree,\nOf Fig-wood one, apart to be:\nOf Sleshmát \nOne column each, the mightiest far:\nSo thick the two, the arms of man\nTheir ample girth would fail to span.\nAll these with utmost care were wrought\nBy hand of priests in Scripture taught,\nAnd all with gold were gilded bright\nTo add new splendour to the rite:\nTwenty-and-one those stakes in all,\nEach one-and-twenty cubits tall:\nAnd one-and-twenty ribbons there\nHung on the pillars, bright and fair.\nFirm in the earth they stood at last,\nWhere cunning craftsmen fixed them fast;\nAnd there unshaken each remained,\nOctagonal and smoothly planed.\nThen ribbons over all were hung,\nAnd flowers and scent around them flung.\nThus decked they cast a glory forth\nLike the great saints who star the north. \nThe sacrificial altar then\nWas raised by skilful twice-born men,\nIn shape and figure to behold\nAn eagle with his wings of gold,\nWith twice nine pits and formed three-fold\nEach for some special God, beside\nThe pillars were the victims tied;\nThe birds that roam the wood, the air,\nThe water, and the land were there,\nAnd snakes and things of reptile birth,\nAnd healing herbs that spring from earth:\nAs texts prescribe, in Scripture found,\nThree hundred victims there were bound.\nThe steed devoted to the host\nOf Gods, the gem they honour most,\nWas duly sprinkled. Then the Queen\nKauśalyá, with delighted mien,\nWith reverent steps around him paced,\nAnd with sweet wreaths the victim graced;\nThen with three swords in order due\nShe smote the steed with joy, and slew.\nThat night the queen, a son to gain,\nWith calm and steady heart was fain\nBy the dead charger's side to stay\nFrom evening till the break of day.\nThen came three priests, their care to lead\nThe other queens to touch the steed,\nUpon Kauśalyá to attend,\nTheir company and aid to lend.\nAs by the horse she still reclined,\nWith happy mien and cheerful mind,\nWith Rishyaśring the twice-born came\nAnd praised and blessed the royal dame.\nThe priest who well his duty knew,\nAnd every sense could well subdue,\nFrom out the bony chambers freed\nAnd boiled the marrow of the steed.\nAbove the steam the monarch bent,\nAnd, as he smelt the fragrant scent,\nIn time and order drove afar\nAll error that his hopes could mar.\nThen sixteen priests together came\nAnd cast into the sacred flame\nThe severed members of the horse,\nMade ready all in ordered course.\nOn piles of holy Fig-tree raised\nThe meaner victims' bodies blazed:\nThe steed, of all the creatures slain,\nAlone required a pile of cane.\nThree days, as is by law decreed,\nLasted that Offering of the Steed.\nThe Chatushṭom began the rite,\nAnd when the sun renewed his light,\nThe Ukthya followed: after came\nThe Atirátra's holy flame.\nThese were the rites, and many more\nArranged by light of holy lore,\nThe Aptoryám of mighty power,\nAnd, each performed in proper hour,\nThe Abhijit and Viśvajit\nWith every form and service fit;\nAnd with the sacrifice at night\nThe Jyotishṭom and Áyus rite. \nThe task was done, as laws prescribe:\nThe monarch, glory of his tribe,\nBestowed the land in liberal grants\nUpon the sacred ministrants.\nHe gave the region of the east,\nHis conquest, to the Hotri priest.\nThe west, the celebrant obtained:\nThe south, the priest presiding gained:\nThe northern region was the share\nOf him who chanted forth the prayer, \nThus did each priest obtain his meed\nAt the great Slaughter of the Steed,\nOrdained, the best of all to be,\nBy self-existent deity.\nIkshváku's son with joyful mind\nThis noble fee to each assigned,\nBut all the priests with one accord\nAddressed that unpolluted lord:\n“Tis thine alone to keep the whole\nOf this broad earth in firm control.\nNo gift of lands from thee we seek:\nTo guard these realms our hands were weak.\nOn sacred lore our days are spent:\nLet other gifts our wants content.”\nThe chief of old Ikshváku's line\nGave them ten hundred thousand kine,\nA hundred millions of fine gold,\nThe same in silver four times told.\nBut every priest in presence there\nWith one accord resigned his share.\nTo Saint Vaśishṭha, high of soul,\nAnd Rishyaśring they gave the whole.\nThat largess pleased those Bráhmans well,\nWho bade the prince his wishes tell.\nThen Daśaratha, mighty king,\nMade answer thus to Rishyaśring:\n“O holy Hermit, of thy grace,\nVouchsafe the increase of my race.”\nHe spoke; nor was his prayer denied:\nThe best of Bráhmans thus replied:\n“Four sons, O Monarch, shall be thine,\nUpholders of thy royal line.”</code>"

shall the sons thou cravest win,\nWhere all things shall be duly sped\nAnd first Atharva texts be read.”\nThen by Vibháṇdak's gentle son\nWas that high sacrifice begun,\nThe king's advantage seeking still\nAnd zealous to perform his will.\nNow all the Gods had gathered there,\nEach one for his allotted share:\nBrahmá, the ruler of the sky,\nStháṇu, Náráyaṇ, Lord most high,\nAnd holy Indra men might view\nWith Maruts  for his retinue;\nThe heavenly chorister, and saint,\nAnd spirit pure from earthly taint,\nWith one accord had sought the place\nThe high-souled monarch's rite to grace.\nThen to the Gods who came to take\nTheir proper share the hermit spake:\n“For you has Daśaratha slain\nThe votive steed, a son to gain;\nStern penance-rites the king has tried,\nAnd in firm faith on you relied,\nAnd now with undiminished care\nA second rite would fain prepare.\nBut, O ye Gods, consent to grant\nThe longing of your supplicant.\nFor him beseeching hands I lift,\nAnd pray you all to grant the gift,\nThat four fair sons of high renown\nThe offerings of the king may crown.”\nThey to the hermit's son replied:\n“His longing shall be gratified.\nFor, Bráhman, in most high degree\nWe love the king and honour thee.”\nThese words the Gods in answer said,\nAnd vanished thence by Indra led.\nThus to the Lord, the worlds who made,\nThe Immortals all assembled prayed:\n“O Brahmá, mighty by thy grace,\nRávaṇ, who rules the giant race,\nTorments us in his senseless pride,\nAnd penance-loving saints beside.\nFor thou well pleased in days of old\nGavest the boon that makes him bold,\nThat God nor demon e'er should kill\nHis charmed life, for so thy will.\nWe, honouring that high behest,\nBear all his rage though sore distressed.\nThat lord of giants fierce and fell\nScourges the earth and heaven and hell.\nMad with thy boon, his impious rage\nSmites saint and bard and God and sage.\nThe sun himself withholds his glow,\nThe wind in fear forbears to blow;\nThe fire restrains his wonted heat\nWhere stand the dreaded Rávaṇ's feet,\nAnd, necklaced with the wandering wave,\nThe sea before him fears to rave.\nKuvera's self in sad defeat\nIs driven from his blissful seat.\nWe see, we feel the giant's might,\nAnd woe comes o'er us and affright.\nTo thee, O Lord, thy suppliants pray\nTo find some cure this plague to stay.”\nThus by the gathered Gods addressed\nHe pondered in his secret breast,\nAnd said: “One only way I find\nTo slay this fiend of evil mind.\nHe prayed me once his life to guard\nFrom demon, God, and heavenly bard,\nAnd spirits of the earth and air,\nAnd I consenting heard his prayer.\nBut the proud giant in his scorn\nRecked not of man of woman born.\nNone else may take his life away,\nBut only man the fiend may slay.”\nThe Gods, with Indra at their head,\nRejoiced to hear the words he said.\nThen crowned with glory like a flame,\nLord Vishṇu to the council came;\nHis hands shell, mace, and discus bore,\nAnd saffron were the robes he wore.\nRiding his eagle through the crowd,\nAs the sun rides upon a cloud,\nWith bracelets of fine gold, he came\nLoud welcomed by the Gods' acclaim.\nHis praise they sang with one consent,\nAnd cried, in lowly reverence bent:\n“O Lord whose hand fierce Madhu  slew,\nBe thou our refuge, firm and true;\nFriend of the suffering worlds art thou,\nWe pray thee help thy suppliants now.”\nThen Vishṇu spake: “Ye Gods, declare,\nWhat may I do to grant your prayer?”\n“King Daśaratha,” thus cried they,\n“Fervent in penance many a day,\nThe sacrificial steed has slain,\nLonging for sons, but all in vain.\nNow, at the cry of us forlorn,\nIncarnate as his seed be born.\nThree queens has he: each lovely dame\nLike Beauty, Modesty, or Fame.\nDivide thyself in four, and be\nHis offspring by these noble three.\nMan's nature take, and slay in fight\nRávaṇ who laughs at heavenly might:\nThis common scourge, this rankling thorn\nWhom the three worlds too long have borne\nFor Rávaṇ in the senseless pride\nOf might unequalled has defied\nThe host of heaven, and plagues with woe\nAngel and bard and saint below,\nCrushing each spirit and each maid\nWho plays in Nandan's  heavenly shade.\nO conquering Lord, to thee we bow;\nOur surest hope and trust art thou.\nRegard the world of men below,\nAnd slay the Gods' tremendous foe.”\nWhen thus the suppliant Gods had prayed,\nHis wise reply Náráyaṇ  made:\n“What task demands my presence there,\nAnd whence this dread, ye Gods declare.”\nThe Gods replied: “We fear, O Lord,\nFierce Rávaṇ, ravener abhorred.\nBe thine the glorious task, we pray,\nIn human form this fiend to slay.\nBy thee of all the Blest alone\nThis sinner may be overthrown.\nHe gained by penance long and dire\nThe favour of the mighty Sire.\nThen He who every gift bestows\nGuarded the fiend from heavenly foes,\nAnd gave a pledge his life that kept\nFrom all things living, man except.\nOn him thus armed no other foe\nThan man may deal the deadly blow.\nAssume, O King, a mortal birth,\nAnd strike the demon to the earth.”\nThen Vishṇu, God of Gods, the Lord\nSupreme by all the worlds adored,\nTo Brahmá and the suppliants spake:\n“Dismiss your fear: for your dear sake\nIn battle will I smite him dead,\nThe cruel fiend, the Immortal's dread.\nAnd lords and ministers and all\nHis kith and kin with him shall fall.\nThen, in the world of mortal men,\nTen thousand years and hundreds ten\nI as a human king will reign,\nAnd guard the earth as my domain.”\nGod, saint, and nymph, and minstrel throng\nWith heavenly voices raised their song\nIn hymns of triumph to the God\nWhose conquering feet on Madhu trod:\n“Champion of Gods, as man appear,\nThis cruel Rávaṇ slay,\nThe thorn that saints and hermits fear,\nThe plague that none can stay.\nIn savage fury uncontrolled\nHis pride for ever grows:\nHe dares the Lord of Gods to hold\nAmong his deadly foes.”</code>"

withdrew,\nEach to his place, with honour due,\nAnd kings and chieftains, one and all,\nWho came to grace the festival.\nAnd Daśaratha, ere they went,\nAddressed them thus benevolent:\n“Now may you, each with joyful heart,\nTo your own realms, O Kings, depart.\nPeace and good luck attend you there,\nAnd blessing, is my friendly prayer;\nLet cares of state each mind engage\nTo guard his royal heritage.\nA monarch from his throne expelled\nNo better than the dead is held.\nSo he who cares for power and might\nMust guard his realm and royal right.\nSuch care a meed in heaven will bring\nBetter than rites and offering.\nSuch care a king his country owes\nAs man upon himself bestows,\nWhen for his body he provides\nRaiment and every need besides.\nFor future days should kings foresee,\nAnd keep the present error-free.”\nThus did the king the kings exhort:\nThey heard, and turned them from the court\nAnd, each to each in friendship bound,\nWent forth to all the realms around.\nThe rites were o'er, the guests were sped:\nThe train the best of Bráhmans led,\nIn which the king with joyful soul,\nWith his dear wives, and with the whole\nOf his imperial host and train\nOf cars and servants turned again,\nAnd, as a monarch dear to fame,\nWithin his royal city came.\nNext, Rishyaśring, well-honoured sage,\nAnd Śántá, sought their hermitage.\nThe king himself, of prudent mind,\nAttended him, with troops behind.\nAnd all her men the town outpoured\nWith Saint Vaśishṭha and their lord.\nHigh mounted on a car of state,\nO'er canopied fair Śántá sate.\nDrawn by white oxen, while a band\nOf servants marched on either hand.\nGreat gifts of countless price she bore,\nWith sheep and goats and gems in store.\nLike Beauty's self the lady shone\nWith all the jewels she had on,\nAs, happy in her sweet content,\nPeerless amid the fair she went.\nNot Queen Paulomí's  self could be\nMore loving to her lord than she.\nShe who had lived in happy ease,\nHonoured with all her heart could please,\nWhile dames and kinsfolk ever vied\nTo see her wishes gratified,\nSoon as she knew her husband's will\nAgain to seek the forest, still\nWas ready for the hermit's cot,\nNor murmured at her altered lot.\nThe king attended to the wild\nThat hermit and his own dear child,\nAnd in the centre of a throng\nOf noble courtiers rode along.\nThe sage's son had let prepare\nA lodge within the wood, and there\nWhile they lingered blithe and gay.\nThen, duly honoured, went their way.\nThe glorious hermit Rishyaśring\nDrew near and thus besought the king:\n“Return, my honoured lord, I pray,\nReturn, upon thy homeward way.”\nThe monarch, with the waiting crowd,\nLifted his voice and wept aloud,\nAnd with eyes dripping still to each\nOf his good queens he spake this speech:\n“Kauśalyá and Sumitrá dear,\nAnd thou, my sweet Kaikeyí, hear.\nAll upon Śántá feast your gaze,\nThe last time for a length of days.”\nTo Śántá's arms the ladies leapt,\nAnd hung about her neck and wept,\nAnd cried, “O, happy be the life\nOf this great Bráhman and his wife.\nThe Wind, the Fire, the Moon on high,\nThe Earth, the Streams, the circling Sky,\nPreserve thee in the wood, true spouse,\nDevoted to thy husband's vows.\nAnd O dear Śántá, ne'er neglect\nTo pay the dues of meek respect\nTo the great saint, thy husband's sire,\nWith all observance and with fire.\nAnd, sweet one, pure of spot and blame,\nForget not thou thy husband's claim;\nIn every change, in good and ill,\nLet thy sweet words delight him still,\nAnd let thy worship constant be:\nHer lord is woman's deity.\nTo learn thy welfare, dearest friend,\nThe king will many a Bráhman send.\nLet happy thoughts thy spirit cheer,\nAnd be not troubled, daughter dear.”\nThese soothing words the ladies said.\nAnd pressed their lips upon her head.\nEach gave with sighs her last adieu,\nThen at the king's command withdrew.\nThe king around the hermit went\nWith circling footsteps reverent,\nAnd placed at Rishyaśring's command\nSome soldiers of his royal band.\nThe Bráhman bowed in turn and cried,\n“May fortune never leave thy side.\nO mighty King, with justice reign,\nAnd still thy people's love retain.”\nHe spoke, and turned away his face,\nAnd, as the hermit went,\nThe monarch, rooted to the place,\nPursued with eyes intent.\nBut when the sage had past from view\nKing Daśaratha turned him too,\nStill fixing on his friend each thought.\nWith such deep love his breast was fraught.\nAmid his people's loud acclaim\nHome to his royal seat he came,\nAnd lived delighted there,\nExpecting when each queenly dame,\nUpholder of his ancient fame,\nHer promised son should bear.\nThe glorious sage his way pursued\nTill close before his eyes he viewed\nSweet Champá, Lomapád's fair town,\nWreathed with her Champacs'  leafy crown.\nSoon as the saint's approach he knew,\nThe king, to yield him honour due,\nWent forth to meet him with a band\nOf priests and nobles of the land:\n“Hail, Sage,” he cried, “O joy to me!\nWhat bliss it is, my lord, to see\nThee with thy wife and all thy train\nReturning to my town again.\nThy father, honoured Sage, is well,\nWho hither from his woodland cell\nHas sent full many a messenger\nFor tidings both of thee and her.”\nThen joyfully, for due respect,\nThe monarch bade the town be decked.\nThe king and Rishyaśring elate\nEntered the royal city's gate:\nIn front the chaplain rode.\nThen, loved and honoured with all care\nBy monarch and by courtier, there\nThe glorious saint abode.</code>"

The princes both obeyed,\nAnd reverence to each river paid. \nThey reached the southern shore at last,\nAnd gaily on their journey passed.\nA little space beyond there stood\nA gloomy awe-inspiring wood.\nThe monarch's noble son began\nTo question thus the holy man:\n“Whose gloomy forest meets mine eye\nLike some vast cloud that fills the sky?\nPathless and dark it seems to be,\nWhere birds in thousands wander free;\nWhere shrill cicadas' cries resound,\nAnd fowl of dismal note abound.\nLion, rhinoceros, and bear,\nBoar, tiger, elephant, are there,\nThere shrubs and thorns run wild:\nDháo, Sál, Bignonia, Bel,  are found,\nAnd every tree that grows on ground.\nHow is the forest styled?”\nThe glorious saint this answer made:\n“Dear child of Raghu, hear\nWho dwells within the horrid shade\nThat looks so dark and drear.\nWhere now is wood, long ere this day\nTwo broad and fertile lands,\nMalaja and Karúsha lay,\nAdorned by heavenly hands.\nHere, mourning friendship's broken ties,\nLord Indra of the thousand eyes\nHungered and sorrowed many a day,\nHis brightness soiled with mud and clay,\nWhen in a storm of passion he\nHad slain his dear friend Namuchi.\nThen came the Gods and saints who bore\nTheir golden pitchers brimming o'er\nWith holy streams that banish stain,\nAnd bathed Lord Indra pure again.\nWhen in this land the God was freed\nFrom spot and stain of impious deed\nFor that his own dear friend he slew,\nHigh transport thrilled his bosom through.\nThen in his joy the lands he blessed,\nAnd gave a boon they long possessed:\n“Because these fertile lands retain\nThe washings of the blot and stain,”\n'Twas thus Lord Indra sware,\n“Malaja and Karúsha's name\nShall celebrate with deathless fame\nMy malady and care.” \n“So be it,” all the Immortals cried,\nWhen Indra's speech they heard,\nAnd with acclaim they ratified\nThe names his lips conferred.\nLong time, O victor of thy foes,\nThese happy lands had sweet repose,\nAnd higher still in fortune rose.\nAt length a spirit, loving ill,\nTáḍaká, wearing shapes at will,\nWhose mighty strength, exceeding vast,\nA thousand elephants, surpassed,\nWas to fierce Sunda, lord and head\nOf all the demon armies, wed.\nFrom her, Lord Indra's peer in might\nGiant Márícha sprang to light:\nAnd she, a constant plague and pest,\nThese two fair realms has long distressed.\nNow dwelling in her dark abode\nA league away she bars the road:\nAnd we, O Ráma, hence must go\nWhere lies the forest of the foe.\nNow on thine own right arm rely,\nAnd my command obey:\nSmite the foul monster that she die,\nAnd take the plague away.\nTo reach this country none may dare\nFallen from its old estate,\nWhich she, whose fury naught can bear,\nHas left so desolate.\nAnd now my truthful tale is told\nHow with accursed sway\nThe spirit plagued this wood of old,\nAnd ceases not to-day.”</code>"

The sage austere,\nTrue to his vows, from evil clear,\nCalled forth the names of those great charms\nWhose powers restrain the deadly arms.\n“Receive thou True and Truly famed,\nAnd Bold and Fleet: the weapons named\nWarder and Progress, swift of pace,\nAverted-head and Drooping-face;\nThe Seen, and that which Secret flies;\nThe weapon of the thousand eyes;\nTen-headed, and the Hundred-faced,\nStar-gazer and the Layer-waste:\nThe Omen-bird, the Pure-from-spot,\nThe pair that wake and slumber not:\nThe Fiendish, that which shakes amain,\nThe Strong-of-Hand, the Rich-in-Gain:\nThe Guardian, and the Close-allied,\nThe Gaper, Love, and Golden-side:\nO Raghu's son receive all these,\nBright ones that wear what forms they please;\nKriśáśva's mystic sons are they,\nAnd worthy thou their might to sway.”\nWith joy the pride of Raghu's race\nReceived the hermit's proffered grace,\nMysterious arms, to check and stay,\nOr smite the foeman in the fray.\nThen, all with heavenly forms endued,\nNigh came the wondrous multitude.\nCelestial in their bright attire\nSome shone like coals of burning fire;\nSome were like clouds of dusky smoke;\nAnd suppliant thus they sweetly spoke:\n“Thy thralls, O Ráma, here we stand:\nCommand, we pray, thy faithful band”\n“Depart,” he cried, “where each may list,\nBut when I call you to assist,\nBe present to my mind with speed,\nAnd aid me in the hour of need.”\nTo Ráma then they lowly bent,\nAnd round him in due reverence went,\nTo his command, they answered, Yea,\nAnd as they came so went away.\nWhen thus the arms had homeward flown,\nWith pleasant words and modest tone,\nE'en as he walked, the prince began\nTo question thus the holy man:\n“What cloudlike wood is that which near\nThe mountain's side I see appear?\nO tell me, for I long to know;\nIts pleasant aspect charms me so.\nIts glades are full of deer at play,\nAnd sweet birds sing on every spray,\nPast is the hideous wild; I feel\nSo sweet a tremor o'er me steal,\nAnd hail with transport fresh and new\nA land that is so fair to view.\nThen tell me all, thou holy Sage,\nAnd whose this pleasant hermitage\nIn which those wicked ones delight\nTo mar and kill each holy rite.\nAnd with foul heart and evil deed\nThy sacrifice, great Saint, impede.\nTo whom, O Sage, belongs this land\nIn which thine altars ready stand!\n'Tis mine to guard them, and to slay\nThe giants who the rites would stay.\nAll this, O best of saints, I burn\nFrom thine own lips, my lord, to learn.”</code>"

The elder consort bare\nA son called Asamanj, the heir.\nThen Sumati, the younger, gave\nBirth to a gourd,  O hero brave,\nWhose rind, when burst and cleft in two,\nGave sixty thousand babes to view.\nAll these with care the nurses laid\nIn jars of oil; and there they stayed,\nTill, youthful age and strength complete,\nForth speeding from each dark retreat,\nAll peers in valour, years, and might,\nThe sixty thousand came to light.\nPrince Asamanj, brought up with care,\nScourge of his foes, was made the heir.\nBut liegemen's boys he used to cast\nTo Sarjú's waves that hurried past,\nLaughing the while in cruel glee\nTheir dying agonies to see.\nThis wicked prince who aye withstood\nThe counsel of the wise and good,\nWho plagued the people in his hate,\nHis father banished from the state.\nHis son, kind-spoken, brave, and tall,\nWas Anśumán, beloved of all.\nLong years flew by. The king decreed\nTo slay a sacrificial steed.\nConsulting with his priestly band\nHe vowed the rite his soul had planned,\nAnd, Veda skilled, by their advice\nMade ready for the sacrifice.</code>"

Then Umá's lord, \nKing of creation, world adored,\nThus spoke to great Bhagírath: “I,\nWell pleased thy wish will gratify,\nAnd on my head her waves shall fling\nThe daughter of the Mountains' King!”\nHe stood upon the lofty crest\nThat crowns the Lord of Snow,\nAnd bade the river of the Blest\nDescend on earth below.\nHimálaya's child, adored of all,\nThe haughty mandate heard,\nAnd her proud bosom, at the call,\nWith furious wrath was stirred.\nDown from her channel in the skies\nWith awful might she sped\nWith a giant's rush, in a giant's size,\nOn Śiva's holy head.\n“He calls me,” in her wrath she cried,\n“And all my flood shall sweep\nAnd whirl him in its whelming tide\nTo hell's profoundest deep.”\nHe held the river on his head,\nAnd kept her wandering, where,\nDense as Himálaya's woods, were spread\nThe tangles of his hair.\nNo way to earth she found, ashamed,\nThough long and sore she strove,\nCondemned, until her pride were tamed,\nAmid his locks to rove.\nThere, many lengthening seasons through,\nThe wildered river ran:\nBhagírath saw it, and anew\nHis penance dire began.\nThen Śiva, for the hermit's sake,\nBade her long wanderings end,\nAnd sinking into Vindu's lake\nHer weary waves descend.\nFrom Gangá, by the God set free,\nSeven noble rivers came;\nHládiní, Pávaní, and she\nCalled Naliní by name:\nThese rolled their lucid waves along\nAnd sought the eastern side.\nSuchakshu, Sítá fair and strong,\nAnd Sindhu's mighty tide— \nThese to the region of the west\nWith joyful waters sped:\nThe seventh, the brightest and the best,\nFlowed where Bhagírath led.\nOn Śiva's head descending first\nA rest the torrents found:\nThen down in all their might they burst\nAnd roared along the ground.\nOn countless glittering scales the beam\nOf rosy morning flashed,\nWhere fish and dolphins through the stream\nFallen and falling dashed.\nThen bards who chant celestial lays\nAnd nymphs of heavenly birth\nFlocked round upon that flood to gaze\nThat streamed from sky to earth.\nThe Gods themselves from every sphere,\nIncomparably bright,\nBorne in their golden cars drew near\nTo see the wondrous sight.\nThe cloudless sky was all aflame\nWith the light of a hundred suns\nWhere'er the shining chariots came\nThat bore those holy ones.\nSo flashed the air with crested snakes\nAnd fish of every hue\nAs when the lightning's glory breaks\nThrough fields of summer blue.\nAnd white foam-clouds and silver spray\nWere wildly tossed on high,\nLike swans that urge their homeward way\nAcross the autumn sky.\nNow ran the river calm and clear\nWith current strong and deep:\nNow slowly broadened to a mere,\nOr scarcely seemed to creep.\nNow o'er a length of sandy plain\nHer tranquil course she held;\nNow rose her waves and sank again,\nBy refluent waves repelled.\nSo falling first on Śiva's head,\nThence rushing to their earthly bed,\nIn ceaseless fall the waters streamed,\nAnd pure with holy lustre gleamed.\nThen every spirit, sage, and bard,\nCondemned to earth by sentence hard,\nPressed eagerly around the tide\nThat Śiva's touch had sanctified.\nThen they whom heavenly doom had hurled,\nAccursed, to this lower world,\nTouched the pure wave, and freed from sin\nResought the skies and entered in.\nAnd all the world was glad, whereon\nThe glorious water flowed and shone,\nFor sin and stain were banished thence\nBy the sweet river's influence.\nFirst, in a car of heavenly frame,\nThe royal saint of deathless name,\nBhagírath, very glorious rode,\nAnd after him fair Gangá flowed.\nGod, sage, and bard, the chief in place\nOf spirits and the Nága race,\nNymph, giant, fiend, in long array\nSped where Bhagírath led the way;\nAnd all the hosts the flood that swim\nFollowed the stream that followed him.\nWhere'er the great Bhagírath led,\nThere ever glorious Gangá fled,\nThe best of floods, the rivers' queen,\nWhose waters wash the wicked clean.\nIt chanced that Jahnu, great and good,\nEngaged with holy offerings stood;\nThe river spread her waves around\nFlooding his sacrificial ground.\nThe saint in anger marked her pride,\nAnd at one draught her stream he dried.\nThen God, and sage, and bard, afraid,\nTo noble high-souled Jahnu prayed,\nAnd begged that he would kindly deem\nHis own dear child that holy stream.\nMoved by their suit, he soothed their fears\nAnd loosed her waters from his ears.\nHence Gangá through the world is styled\nBoth Jáhnavi and Jahnu's child.\nThen onward still she followed fast,\nAnd reached the great sea bank at last.\nThence deep below her way she made\nTo end those rites so long delayed.\nThe monarch reached the Ocean's side,\nAnd still behind him Gangá hied.\nHe sought the depths which open lay\nWhere Sagar's sons had dug their way.\nSo leading through earth's nether caves\nThe river's purifying waves,\nOver his kinsmen's dust the lord\nHis funeral libation poured.\nSoon as the flood their dust bedewed,\nTheir spirits gained beatitude,\nAnd all in heavenly bodies dressed\nRose to the skies' eternal rest.\nThen thus to King Bhagírath said\nBrahmá, when, coming at the head\nOf all his bright celestial train,\nHe saw those spirits freed from stain:\n“Well done! great Prince of men, well done!\nThy kinsmen bliss and heaven have won.\nThe sons of Sagar mighty-souled,\nAre with the Blest, as Gods, enrolled,\nLong as the Ocean's flood shall stand\nUpon the border of the land,\nSo long shall Sagar's sons remain,\nAnd, godlike, rank in heaven retain.\nGangá thine eldest child shall be,\nCalled from thy name Bhágirathí;\nNamed also—for her waters fell\nFrom heaven and flow through earth and hell—\nTripathagá, stream of the skies,\nBecause three paths she glorifies.\nAnd, mighty King, 'tis given thee now\nTo free thee and perform thy vow.\nNo longer, happy Prince, delay\nDrink-offerings to thy kin to pay.\nFor this the holiest Sagar sighed,\nBut mourned the boon he sought denied.\nThen Anśumán, dear Prince! although\nNo brighter name the world could show,\nStrove long the heavenly flood to gain\nTo visit earth, but strove in vain.\nNor was she by the sages' peer,\nBlest with all virtues, most austere,\nThy sire Dilípa, hither brought,\nThough with fierce prayers the boon he sought.\nBut thou, O King, earned success,\nAnd won high fame which God will bless.\nThrough thee, O victor of thy foes,\nOn earth this heavenly Gangá flows,\nAnd thou hast gained the meed divine\nThat waits on virtue such as thine.\nNow in her ever holy wave\nThyself, O best of heroes, lave:\nSo shalt thou, pure from every sin,\nThe blessed fruit of merit win.\nNow for thy kin who died of yore\nThe meet libations duly pour.\nAbove the heavens I now ascend:\nDepart, and bliss thy steps attend.”\nThus to the mighty king who broke\nHis foemens' might, Lord Brahmá spoke,\nAnd with his Gods around him rose\nTo his own heaven of blest repose.\nThe royal sage no more delayed,\nBut, the libation duly paid,\nHome to his regal city hied\nWith water cleansed and purified.\nThere ruled he his ancestral state,\nBest of all men, most fortunate.\nAnd all the people joyed again\nIn good Bhagírath's gentle reign.\nRich, prosperous, and blest were they,\nAnd grief and sickness fled away.\nThus, Ráma, I at length have told\nHow Gangá came from heaven of old.\nNow, for the evening passes swift,\nI wish thee each auspicious gift.\nThis story of the flood's descent\nWill give—for 'tis most excellent—\nWealth, purity, fame, length of days,\nAnd to the skies its hearers raise”</code>"

The morning rites were done\nAnd the victorious Raghu's son\nAddressed the sage in words like these,\nRich in his long austerities:\n“The night is past: the morn is clear;\nTold is the tale so good to hear:\nNow o'er that river let us go,\nThree-pathed, the best of all that flow.\nThis boat stands ready on the shore\nTo bear the holy hermits o'er,\nWho of thy coming warned, in haste,\nThe barge upon the bank have placed.”\nAnd Kuśik's son approved his speech,\nAnd moving to the sandy beach,\nPlaced in the boat the hermit band,\nAnd reached the river's further strand.\nOn the north bank their feet they set,\nAnd greeted all the saints they met.\nOn Gangá's shore they lighted down,\nAnd saw Viśálá's lovely town.\nThither, the princes by his side,\nThe best of holy hermits hied.\nIt was a town exceeding fair\nThat might with heaven itself compare.\nThen, suppliant palm to palm applied,\nFamed Ráma asked his holy guide:\n“O best of hermits, say what race\nOf monarchs rules this lovely place.\nDear master, let my prayer prevail,\nFor much I long to hear the tale.”\nMoved by his words, the saintly man\nViśálá's ancient tale began:\n“List, Ráma, list, with closest heed\nThe tale of Indra's wondrous deed,\nAnd mark me as I truly tell\nWhat here in ancient days befell.\nEre Krita's famous Age  had fled,\nStrong were the sons of Diti  bred;\nAnd Aditi's brave children too\nWere very mighty, good, and true.\nThe rival brothers fierce and bold\nWere sons of Kaśyap lofty-souled.\nOf sister mothers born, they vied,\nBrood against brood, in jealous pride.\nOnce, as they say, band met with band,\nAnd, joined in awful council, planned\nTo live, unharmed by age and time,\nImmortal in their youthful prime.\nThen this was, after due debate,\nThe counsel of the wise and great,\nTo churn with might the milky sea \nThe life-bestowing drink to free.\nThis planned, they seized the Serpent King,\nVásuki, for their churning-string,\nAnd Mandar's mountain for their pole,\nAnd churned with all their heart and soul.\nAs thus, a thousand seasons through,\nThis way and that the snake they drew,\nBiting the rocks, each tortured head,\nA very deadly venom shed.\nThence, bursting like a mighty flame,\nA pestilential poison came,\nConsuming, as it onward ran,\nThe home of God, and fiend, and man.\nThen all the suppliant Gods in fear\nTo Śankar,  mighty lord, drew near.\nTo Rudra, King of Herds, dismayed,\n“Save us, O save us, Lord!” they prayed.\nThen Vishṇu, bearing shell, and mace,\nAnd discus, showed his radiant face,\nAnd thus addressed in smiling glee\nThe Trident wielding deity:\n“What treasure first the Gods upturn\nFrom troubled Ocean, as they churn,\nShould—for thou art the eldest—be\nConferred, O best of Gods, on thee.\nThen come, and for thy birthright's sake,\nThis venom as thy first fruits take.”\nHe spoke, and vanished from their sight,\nWhen Śiva saw their wild affright,\nAnd heard his speech by whom is borne\nThe mighty bow of bending horn, \nThe poisoned flood at once he quaffed\nAs 'twere the Amrit's heavenly draught.\nThen from the Gods departing went\nŚiva, the Lord pre-eminent.\nThe host of Gods and Asurs still\nKept churning with one heart and will.\nBut Mandar's mountain, whirling round,\nPierced to the depths below the ground.\nThen Gods and bards in terror flew\nTo him who mighty Madhu slew.\n“Help of all beings! more than all,\nThe Gods on thee for aid may call.\nWard off, O mighty-armed! our fate,\nAnd bear up Mandar's threatening weight.”\nThen Vishṇu, as their need was sore,\nThe semblance of a tortoise wore,\nAnd in the bed of Ocean lay\nThe mountain on his back to stay.\nThen he, the soul pervading all,\nWhose locks in radiant tresses fall,\nOne mighty arm extended still,\nAnd grasped the summit of the hill.\nSo ranged among the Immortals, he\nJoined in the churning of the sea.\nA thousand years had reached their close,\nWhen calmly from the ocean rose\nThe gentle sage  with staff and can,\nLord of the art of healing man.\nThen as the waters foamed and boiled,\nAs churning still the Immortals toiled,\nOf winning face and lovely frame,\nForth sixty million fair ones came.\nBorn of the foam and water, these\nWere aptly named Apsarases. \nEach had her maids. The tongue would fail—\nSo vast the throng—to count the tale.\nBut when no God or Titan wooed\nA wife from all that multitude,\nRefused by all, they gave their love\nIn common to the Gods above.\nThen from the sea still vext and wild\nRose Surá,  Varuṇ's maiden child.\nA fitting match she sought to find:\nBut Diti's sons her love declined,\nTheir kinsmen of the rival brood\nTo the pure maid in honour sued.\nHence those who loved that nymph so fair\nThe hallowed name of Suras bear.\nAnd Asurs are the Titan crowd\nHer gentle claims who disallowed.\nThen from the foamy sea was freed\nUchchaihśravas,  the generous steed,\nAnd Kaustubha, of gems the gem, \nAnd Soma, Moon God, after them.\nAt length when many a year had fled,\nUp floated, on her lotus bed,\nA maiden fair and tender-eyed,\nIn the young flush of beauty's pride.\nShe shone with pearl and golden sheen,\nAnd seals of glory stamped her queen,\nOn each round arm glowed many a gem,\nOn her smooth brows, a diadem.\nRolling in waves beneath her crown\nThe glory of her hair flowed down,\nPearls on her neck of price untold,\nThe lady shone like burnisht gold.\nQueen of the Gods, she leapt to land,\nA lotus in her perfect hand,\nAnd fondly, of the lotus-sprung,\nTo lotus-bearing Vishṇu clung.\nHer Gods above and men below\nAs Beauty's Queen and Fortune know. \nGods, Titans, and the minstrel train\nStill churned and wrought the troubled main.\nAt length the prize so madly sought,\nThe Amrit, to their sight was brought.\nFor the rich spoil, 'twixt these and those\nA fratricidal war arose,\nAnd, host 'gainst host in battle, set,\nAditi's sons and Diti's met.\nUnited, with the giants' aid,\nTheir fierce attack the Titans made,\nAnd wildly raged for many a day\nThat universe-astounding fray.\nWhen wearied arms were faint to strike,\nAnd ruin threatened all alike,\nVishṇu, with art's illusive aid,\nThe Amrit from their sight conveyed.\nThat Best of Beings smote his foes\nWho dared his deathless arm oppose:\nYea, Vishṇu, all-pervading God,\nBeneath his feet the Titans trod\nAditi's race, the sons of light,\nslew Diti's brood in cruel fight.\nThen town-destroying  Indra gained\nHis empire, and in glory reigned\nO'er the three worlds with bard and sage\nRejoicing in his heritage.</code>"

My lord, Good-bye!\nRegard me with a friendly eye.”\nHim speaking thus Vaśishṭha stayed,\nAnd still to share his banquet prayed.\nThe will of Gádhi's son he bent,\nAnd won the monarch to consent,\nWho spoke in answer. “Let it be,\nGreat Hermit, as it pleases thee.”\nWhen, best of those who breathe the prayer,\nHe heard the king his will declare,\nHe called the cow of spotted skin,\nAll spot without, all pure within.\n“Come, Dapple-skin,” he cried, “with speed;\nHear thou my words and help at need.\nMy heart is set to entertain\nThis monarch and his mighty train\nWith sumptuous meal and worthy fare;\nBe thine the banquet to prepare.\nEach dainty cate, each goodly dish,\nOf six-fold taste  as each may wish—\nAll these, O cow of heavenly power,\nRain down for me in copious shower:\nViands and drink for tooth and lip,\nTo eat, to suck, to quaff, to sip—\nOf these sufficient, and to spare,\nO plenty-giving cow, prepare.”</code>"

The troubled damsel sighed\nSighs long and hot, and thus replied:\n“What madness has possessed thy mind,\nTo warnings deaf, to dangers blind?\nCanst thou not see the floods of woe\nThat threaten o'er thine head to flow:\nFirst Ráma will the throne acquire,\nThen Ráma's son succeed his sire,\nWhile Bharat will neglected pine\nExcluded from the royal line.\nNot all his sons, O lady fair,\nThe kingdom of a monarch share:\nAll ruling when a sovereign dies\nWild tumult in the state would rise.\nThe eldest, be he good or ill,\nIs ruler by the father's will.\nKnow, tender mother, that thy son\nWithout a friend and all undone,\nFar from the joyous ease of home\nAn alien from his race will roam.\nI sped to thee for whom I feel,\nBut thy fond heart mistakes my zeal,\nThy hand a present would bestow\nBecause thy rival triumphs so.\nWhen Ráma once begins his sway\nWithout a foe his will to stay,\nThy darling Bharat he will drive\nTo distant lands if left alive.\nBy thee the child was sent away\nBeneath his grandsire's roof to stay.\nEven in stocks and stones perforce\nWill friendship spring from intercourse.\nThe young Śatrughna too would go\nWith Bharat, for he loved him so.\nAs Lakshmaṇ still to Ráma cleaves,\nHe his dear Bharat never leaves.\nThere is an ancient tale they tell:\nA tree the foresters would fell\nWas saved by reeds that round it stood,\nFor love that sprang of neighbourhood.\nSo Lakshmaṇ Ráma will defend,\nAnd each on each for aid depend.\nSuch fame on earth their friendship wins\nAs that which binds the Heavenly Twins.\nAnd Ráma ne'er will purpose wrong\nTo Lakshmaṇ, for their love is strong.\nBut Bharat, Oh, of this be sure,\nMust evil at his hands endure.\nCome, Ráma from his home expel\nAn exile in the woods to dwell.\nThe plan, O Queen, which I advise\nSecures thy weal if thou be wise.\nSo we and all thy kith and kin\nAdvantage from thy gain shall win.\nShall Bharat, meet for happier fate,\nBorn to endure his rival's hate,\nWith all his fortune ruined cower\nAnd dread his brother's mightier power!\nUp, Queen, to save thy son, arise;\nProstrate at Ráma's feet he lies.\nSo the proud elephant who leads\nHis trooping consorts through the reeds\nFalls in the forest shade beneath\nThe lion's spring and murderous teeth.\nScorned by thee in thy bliss and pride\nKauśalyá was of old defied,\nAnd will she now forbear to show\nThe vengeful rancour of a foe?\nO Queen, thy darling is undone\nWhen Ráma's hand has once begun\nAyodhyá's realm to sway,\nCome, win the kingdom for thy child\nAnd drive the alien to the wild\nIn banishment to-day.”</code>"

The wicked maid\nThe mandate of her queen obeyed,\nAnd darkly plotting Ráma's fall\nResponded to Kaikeyí's call.\n“I will declare, do thou attend,\nHow Bharat may his throne ascend.\nDost thou forget what things befell?\nOr dost thou feign, remembering well?\nOr wouldst thou hear my tongue repeat\nA story for thy need so meet?\nGay lady, if thy will be so,\nNow hear the tale of long ago,\nAnd when my tongue has done its part\nPonder the story in thine heart.\nWhen Gods and demons fought of old,\nThy lord, with royal saints enrolled,\nSped to the war with thee to bring\nHis might to aid the Immortals' King.\nFar to the southern land he sped\nWhere Daṇḍak's mighty wilds are spread,\nTo Vaijayanta's city swayed\nBy Śambara, whose flag displayd\nThe hugest monster of the sea.\nLord of a hundred wiles was be;\nWith might which Gods could never blame\nAgainst the King of Heaven he came.\nThen raged the battle wild and dread,\nAnd mortal warriors fought and bled;\nThe fiends by night with strength renewed\nCharged, slew the sleeping multitude.\nThy lord, King Daśaratha, long\nStood fighting with the demon throng,\nBut long of arm, unmatched in strength,\nFell wounded by their darts at length.\nThy husband, senseless, by thine aid\nWas from the battle field conveyed,\nAnd wounded nigh to death thy lord\nWas by thy care to health restored.\nWell pleased the grateful monarch sware\nTo grant thy first and second prayer.\nThou for no favour then wouldst sue,\nThe gifts reserved for season due;\nAnd he, thy high-souled lord, agreed\nTo give the boons when thou shouldst need.\nMyself I knew not what befell,\nBut oft the tale have heard thee tell,\nAnd close to thee in friendship knit\nDeep in my heart have treasured it.\nRemind thy husband of his oath,\nRecall the boons and claim them both,\nThat Bharat on the throne be placed\nWith rites of consecration graced,\nAnd Ráma to the woods be sent\nFor twice seven years of banishment.\nGo, Queen, the mourner's chamber  seek,\nWith angry eye and burning cheek;\nAnd with disordered robes and hair\nOn the cold earth lie prostrate there.\nWhen the king comes still mournful lie,\nSpeak not a word nor meet his eye,\nBut let thy tears in torrent flow,\nAnd lie enamoured of thy woe.\nWell do I know thou long hast been,\nAnd ever art, his darling queen.\nFor thy dear sake, O well-loved dame,\nThe mighty king would brave the flame,\nBut ne'er would anger thee, or brook\nTo meet his favourite's wrathful look.\nThy loving lord would even die\nThy fancy, Queen, to gratify,\nAnd never could he arm his breast\nTo answer nay to thy request.\nListen and learn, O dull of sense,\nThine all-resistless influence.\nGems he will offer, pearls and gold:\nRefuse his gifts, be stern and cold.\nThose proffered boons at length recall,\nAnd claim them till he grants thee all.\nAnd O my lady, high in bliss,\nWith heedful thought forget not this.\nWhen from the ground his queen he lifts\nAnd grants again the promised gifts,\nBind him with oaths he cannot break\nAnd thy demands unflnching, make.\nThat Ráma travel to the wild\nFive years and nine from home exiled,\nAnd Bharat, best of all who reign,\nThe empire of the land obtain.\nFor when this term of years has fled\nOver the banished Ráma's head,\nThy royal son to vigour grown\nAnd rooted firm will stand alone.\nThe king, I know, is well inclined,\nAnd this the hour to move his mind.\nBe bold: the threatened rite prevent,\nAnd force the king from his intent.”\nShe ceased. So counselled to her bane\nDisguised beneath a show of gain,\nKaikeyí in her joy and pride\nTo Manthará again replied:\n“Thy sense I envy, prudent maid;\nWith sagest lore thy lids persuade.\nNo hump-back maid in all the earth,\nFor wise resolve, can match thy worth.\nThou art alone with constant zeal\nDevoted to thy lady's weal.\nDear girl, without thy faithful aid\nI had not marked the plot he laid.\nFull of all guile and sin and spite\nMisshapen hump-backs shock the sight:\nBut thou art fair and formed to please,\nBent like a lily by the breeze.\nI look thee o'er with watchful eye,\nAnd in thy frame no fault can spy;\nThe chest so deep, the waist so trim,\nSo round the lines of breast and limb. \nThy cheeks with moonlike beauty shine,\nAnd the warm wealth of youth is thine.\nThy legs, my girl, are long and neat,\nAnd somewhat long thy dainty feet,\nWhile stepping out before my face\nThou seemest like a crane to pace.\nThe thousand wiles are in thy breast\nWhich Śambara the fiend possessed,\nAnd countless others all thine own,\nO damsel sage, to thee are known.\nThy very hump becomes thee too,\nO thou whose face is fair to view,\nFor there reside in endless store\nPlots, wizard wiles, and warrior lore.\nA golden chain I'll round it fling\nWhen Ráma's flight makes Bharat king:\nYea, polished links of finest gold,\nWhen once the wished for prize I hold\nWith naught to fear and none to hate,\nThy hump, dear maid, shall decorate.\nA golden frontlet wrought with care,\nAnd precious jewels shalt thou wear:\nTwo lovely robes around thee fold,\nAnd walk a Goddess to behold,\nBidding the moon himself compare\nHis beauty with a face so fair.\nWith scent of precious sandal sweet\nDown to the nails upon thy feet,\nFirst of the household thou shalt go\nAnd pay with scorn each battled foe.”\nKaikeyí's praise the damsel heard,\nAnd thus again her lady stirred,\nWho lay upon her beauteous bed\nLike fire upon the altar fed:\n“Dear Queen, they build the bridge in vain\nWhen swollen streams are dry again.\nArise, thy glorious task complete,\nAnd draw the king to thy retreat.”\nThe large-eyed lady left her bower\nExulting in her pride of power,\nAnd with the hump-back sought the gloom\nAnd silence of the mourner's room.\nThe string of priceless pearls that hung\nAround her neck to earth she flung,\nWith all the wealth and lustre lent\nBy precious gem and ornament.\nThen, listening to her slave's advice,\nLay, like a nymph from Paradise.\nAs on the ground her limbs she laid\nOnce more she cried unto the maid:\n“Soon must thou to the monarch say\nKaikeyí's soul has past away,\nOr, Ráma banished as we planned,\nMy son made king shall rule the land.\nNo more for gold and gems I care,\nFor brave attire or dainty fare.\nIf Ráma should the throne ascend,\nThat very hour my life will end.”\nThe royal lady wounded through\nThe bosom with the darts that flew\nLaunched from the hump-back's tongue\nPressed both her hands upon her side,\nAnd o'er and o'er again she cried\nWith wildering fury stung:\n“Yes, it shall be thy task to tell\nThat I have hurried hence to dwell\nIn Yáma's realms of woe,\nOr happy Bharat shall be king,\nAnd doomed to years of wandering\nKauśalyá's son shall go.\nI heed not dainty viands now\nFair wreaths of flowers to twine my brow,\nSoft balm or precious scent:\nMy very life I count as naught,\nNothing on earth can claim my thought\nBut Ráma's banishment.”\nShe spoke these words of cruel ire;\nThen stripping off her gay attire,\nThe cold bare floor she pressed.\nSo, falling from her home on high,\nSome lovely daughter of the sky\nUpon the ground might rest.\nWith darkened brow and furious mien,\nStripped of her gems and wreath, the queen\nIn spotless beauty lay,\nLike heaven obscured with gathering cloud,\nWhen shades of midnight darkness shroud\nEach star's expiring ray.</code>"

hunter's venomed dart.\nThe lovely lady in her mind\nRevolved the plot her maid designed,\nAnd prompt the gain and risk to scan\nShe step by step approved the plan.\nMisguided by the hump-back's guile\nShe pondered her resolve awhile,\nAs the fair path that bliss secured\nThe miserable lady lured,\nDevoted to her queen, and swayed\nBy hopes of gain and bliss, the maid\nRejoiced, her lady's purpose known,\nAnd deemed the prize she sought her own.\nThen bent upon her purpose dire,\nKaikeyí with her soul on fire,\nUpon the floor lay, languid, down,\nHer brows contracted in a frown.\nThe bright-hued wreath that bound her hair,\nChains, necklets, jewels rich and rare,\nStripped off by her own fingers lay\nSpread on the ground in disarray,\nAnd to the floor a lustre lent\nAs stars light up the firmament.\nThus prostrate in the mourner's cell,\nIn garb of woe the lady fell,\nHer long hair in a single braid,\nLike some fair nymph of heaven dismayed. \nThe monarch, Ráma to install,\nWith thoughtful care had ordered all,\nAnd now within his home withdrew,\nDismissing first his retinue.\nNow all the town has heard, thought he,\nWhat joyful rite the morn will see.\nSo turned he to her bower to cheer\nWith the glad news his darling's ear.\nMajestic, as the Lord of Night,\nWhen threatened by the Dragon's might,\nBursts radiant on the evening sky\nPale with the clouds that wander by,\nSo Daśaratha, great in fame,\nTo Queen Kaikeyí's palace came.\nThere parrots flew from tree to tree,\nAnd gorgeous peacocks wandered free,\nWhile ever and anon was heard\nThe note of some glad water-bird.\nHere loitered dwarf and hump-backed maid,\nThere lute and lyre sweet music played.\nHere, rich in blossom, creepers twined\nO'er grots with wondrous art designed,\nThere Champac and Aśoka flowers\nHung glorious o'er the summer bowers,\nAnd mid the waving verdure rose\nGold, silver, ivory porticoes.\nThrough all the months in ceaseless store\nThe trees both fruit and blossom bore.\nWith many a lake the grounds were graced;\nSeats gold and silver, here were placed;\nHere every viand wooed the taste,\nIt was a garden meet to vie\nE'en with the home of Gods on high.\nWithin the mansion rich and vast\nThe mighty Daśaratha passed:\nNot there was his beloved queen\nOn her fair couch reclining seen.\nWith love his eager pulses beat\nFor the dear wife he came to meet,\nAnd in his blissful hopes deceived,\nHe sought his absent love and grieved.\nFor never had she missed the hour\nOf meeting in her sumptuous bower,\nAnd never had the king of men\nEntered the empty room till then.\nStill urged by love and anxious thought\nNews of his favourite queen he sought,\nFor never had his loving eyes\nFound her or selfish or unwise.\nThen spoke at length the warder maid,\nWith hands upraised and sore afraid:\n“My Lord and King, the queen has sought\nThe mourner's cell with rage distraught.”\nThe words the warder maiden said\nHe heard with soul disquieted,\nAnd thus as fiercer grief assailed,\nHis troubled senses wellnigh failed.\nConsumed by torturing fires of grief\nThe king, the world's imperial chief,\nHis lady lying on the ground\nIn most unqueenly posture, found.\nThe aged king, all pure within,\nSaw the young queen resolved on sin,\nLow on the ground, his own sweet wife,\nTo him far dearer than his life,\nLike some fair creeping plant uptorn,\nOr like a maid of heaven forlorn,\nA nymph of air or Goddess sent\nFrom Swarga down in banishment.\nAs some wild elephant who tries\nTo soothe his consort as she lies\nStruck by the hunter's venomed dart,\nSo the great king disturbed in heart,\nStrove with soft hand and fond caress\nTo soothe his darling queen's distress,\nAnd in his love addressed with sighs\nThe lady of the lotus eyes:\n“I know not, Queen, why thou shouldst be\nThus angered to the heart with me.\nSay, who has slighted thee, or whence\nHas come the cause of such offence\nThat in the dust thou liest low,\nAnd rendest my fond heart with woe,\nAs if some goblin of the night\nHad struck thee with a deadly blight,\nAnd cast foul influence on her\nWhose spells my loving bosom stir?\nI have Physicians famed for skill,\nEach trained to cure some special ill:\nMy sweetest lady, tell thy pain,\nAnd they shall make thee well again.\nWhom, darling, wouldst thou punished see?\nOr whom enriched with lordly fee?\nWeep not, my lovely Queen, and stay\nThis grief that wears thy frame away;\nSpeak, and the guilty shall be freed.\nThe guiltless be condemned to bleed,\nThe poor enriched, the rich abased,\nThe low set high, the proud disgraced.\nMy lords and I thy will obey,\nAll slaves who own thy sovereign sway;\nAnd I can ne'er my heart incline\nTo check in aught one wish of thine.\nNow by my life I pray thee tell\nThe thoughts that in thy bosom dwell.\nThe power and might thou knowest well,\nShould from thy breast all doubt expel.\nI swear by all my merit won,\nSpeak, and thy pleasure shall be done.\nFar as the world's wide bounds extend\nMy glorious empire knows no end.\nMine are the tribes in eastern lands,\nAnd those who dwell on Sindhu's sands:\nMine is Suráshṭra, far away,\nSuvíra's realm admits my sway.\nMy best the southern nations fear,\nThe Angas and the Vangas hear.\nAnd as lord paramount I reign\nO'er Magadh and the Matsyas' plain,\nKośal, and Káśi's wide domain: \nAll rich in treasures of the mine,\nIn golden corn, sheep, goats, and kine.\nChoose what thou wilt. Kaikeyí, thence:\nBut tell me, O my darling, whence\nArose thy grief, and it shall fly\nLike hoar-frost when the sun is high.”\nShe, by his loving words consoled,\nLonged her dire purpose to unfold,\nAnd sought with sharper pangs to wring\nThe bosom of her lord the king.</code>"

assail?\nOr do my troubled senses fail?\nDoes some dire portent scare my view?\nOr frenzy's stroke my soul subdue?”\nThus as he thought, his troubled mind\nIn doubt and dread no rest could find,\nDistressed and trembling like a deer\nWho sees the dreaded tigress near.\nOn the bare ground his limbs he threw,\nAnd many a long deep sigh he drew,\nLike a wild snake, with fury blind,\nBy charms within a ring confined.\nOnce as the monarch's fury woke,\n“Shame on thee!” from his bosom broke,\nAnd then in sense-bewildering pain\nHe fainted on the ground again.\nAt length, when slowly strength returned,\nHe answered as his eyeballs burned\nWith the wild fury of his ire\nConsuming her, as 'twere, with fire:\n“Fell traitress, thou whose thoughts design\nThe utter ruin of my line,\nWhat wrong have I or Ráma done?\nSpeak murderess, speak thou wicked one,\nSeeks he not evermore to please\nThee with all sonlike courtesies?\nBy what persuasion art thou led\nTo bring this ruin on his head?\nAh me, that fondly unaware\nI brought thee home my life to share,\nCalled daughter of a king, in truth\nA serpent with a venomed tooth!\nWhat fault can I pretend to find\nIn Ráma praised by all mankind,\nThat I my darling should forsake?\nNo, take my life, my glory take:\nLet either queen be from me torn,\nBut not my well-loved eldest-born.\nHim but to see is highest bliss,\nAnd death itself his face to miss.\nThe world may sunless stand, the grain\nMay thrive without the genial rain,\nBut if my Ráma be not nigh\nMy spirit from its frame will fly.\nEnough, thine impious plan forgo,\nO thou who plottest sin and woe.\nMy head before thy feet, I kneel,\nAnd pray thee some compassion feel.\nO wicked dame, what can have led\nThy heart to dare a plot so dread?\nPerchance thy purpose is to sound\nThe grace thy son with me has found;\nPerchance the words that, all these days,\nThou still hast said in Ráma's praise,\nWere only feigned, designed to cheer\nWith flatteries a father's ear.\nSoon as thy grief, my Queen, I knew,\nMy bosom felt the anguish too.\nIn empty halls art thou possessed,\nAnd subject to anothers' hest?\nNow on Ikshváku's ancient race\nFalls foul disorder and disgrace,\nIf thou, O Queen, whose heart so long\nHas loved the good should choose the wrong.\nNot once, O large-eyed dame, hast thou\nBeen guilty of offence till now,\nNor said a word to make me grieve,\nNow will I now thy sin believe.\nWith thee my Ráma used to hold\nLike place with Bharat lofty-souled.\nAs thou so often, when the pair\nWere children yet, wouldst fain declare.\nAnd can thy righteous soul endure\nThat Ráma glorious, pious, pure,\nShould to the distant wilds be sent\nFor fourteen years of banishment?\nYea, Ráma Bharat's self exceeds\nIn love to thee and sonlike deeds,\nAnd, for deserving love of thee,\nAs Bharat, even so is he.\nWho better than that chieftain may\nObedience, love, and honour pay,\nThy dignity with care protect,\nThy slightest word and wish respect?\nOf all his countless followers none\nCan breathe a word against my son;\nOf many thousands not a dame\nCan hint reproach or whisper blame.\nAll creatures feel the sweet control\nOf Ráma's pure and gentle soul.\nThe pride of Manu's race he binds\nTo him the people's grateful minds.\nHe wins the subjects with his truth,\nThe poor with gifts and gentle ruth,\nHis teachers with his docile will,\nThe foemen with his archer skill.\nTruth, purity, religious zeal,\nThe hand to give, the heart to feel,\nThe love that ne'er betrays a friend,\nThe rectitude that naught can bend,\nKnowledge, and meek obedience grace\nMy Ráma pride of Raghu's race.\nCanst thou thine impious plot design\n'Gainst him in whom these virtues shine,\nWhose glory with the sages vies,\nPeer of the Gods who rule the skies!\nFrom him no harsh or bitter word\nTo pain one creature have I heard,\nAnd how can I my son address,\nFor thee, with words of bitterness?\nHave mercy, Queen: some pity show\nTo see my tears of anguish flow,\nAnd listen to my mournful cry,\nA poor old man who soon must die.\nWhate'er this sea-girt land can boast\nOf rich and rare from coast to coast,\nTo thee, my Queen, I give it all:\nBut O, thy deadly words recall:\nO see, my suppliant hands entreat,\nAgain my lips are on thy feet:\nSave Ráma, save my darling child,\nNor kill me with this sin defiled.”\nHe grovelled on the ground, and lay\nTo burning grief a senseless prey,\nAnd ever and anon, assailed\nBy floods of woe he wept and wailed,\nStriving with eager speed to gain\nThe margent of his sea of pain.\nWith fiercer words she fiercer yet\nThe hapless father's pleading met:\n“O Monarch, if thy soul repent\nThe promise and thy free consent,\nHow wilt thou in the world maintain\nThy fame for truth unsmirched with stain?\nWhen gathered kings with thee converse,\nAnd bid thee all the tale rehearse,\nWhat wilt thou say, O truthful King,\nIn answer to their questioning?\n“She to whose love my life I owe,\nWho saved me smitten by the foe,\nKaikeyí, for her tender care,\nWas cheated of the oath I sware.”\nThus wilt thou answer, and forsworn\nWilt draw on thee the princes' scorn.\nLearn from that tale, the Hawk and Dove, \nHow strong for truth was Saivya's love.\nPledged by his word the monarch gave\nHis flesh the suppliant bird to save.\nSo King Alarka gave his eyes,\nAnd gained a mansion in the skies.\nThe Sea himself his promise keeps,\nAnd ne'er beyond his limit sweeps.\nMy deeds of old again recall,\nNor let thy bond dishonoured fall.\nThe rights of truth thou wouldst forget,\nThy Ráma on the throne to set,\nAnd let thy days in pleasure glide,\nFond King, Kauśalyá by thy side.\nNow call it by what name thou wilt,\nJustice, injustice, virtue, guilt,\nThy word and oath remain the same,\nAnd thou must yield what thus I claim.\nIf Ráma be anointed, I\nThis very day will surely die,\nBefore thy face will poison drink,\nAnd lifeless at thy feet will sink.\nYea, better far to die than stay\nAlive to see one single day\nThe crowds before Kauśalyá stand\nAnd hail her queen with reverent hand.\nNow by my son, myself, I swear,\nNo gift, no promise whatsoe'er\nMy steadfast soul shall now content,\nBut only Ráma's banishment.”\nSo far she spake by rage impelled,\nAnd then the queen deep silence held.\nHe heard her speech full fraught with ill,\nBut spoke no word bewildered still,\nGazed on his love once held so dear\nWho spoke unlovely rede to hear;\nThen as he slowly pondered o'er\nThe queen's resolve and oath she swore.\nOnce sighing forth, Ah Ráma! he\nFell prone as falls a smitten tree.\nHis senses lost like one insane,\nFaint as a sick man weak with pain,\nOr like a wounded snake dismayed,\nSo lay the king whom earth obeyed.\nLong burning sighs he slowly heaved,\nAs, conquered by his woe, he grieved,\nAnd thus with tears and sobs between\nHis sad faint words addressed the queen:\n“By whom, Kaikeyí, wast thou taught\nThis flattering hope with ruin fraught?\nHave goblins seized thy soul, O dame,\nWho thus canst speak and feel no shame?\nThy mind with sin is sicklied o'er,\nFrom thy first youth ne'er seen before.\nA good and loving wife wast thou,\nBut all, alas! is altered now.\nWhat terror can have seized thy breast\nTo make thee frame this dire request,\nThat Bharat o'er the land may reign,\nAnd Ráma in the woods remain?\nTurn from thine evil ways, O turn,\nAnd thy perfidious counsel spurn,\nIf thou would fain a favour do\nTo people, lord, and Bharat too.\nO wicked traitress, fierce and vile,\nWho lovest deeds of sin and guile,\nWhat crime or grievance dost thou see,\nWhat fault in Ráma or in me?\nThy son will ne'er the throne accept\nIf Ráma from his rights be kept,\nFor Bharat's heart more firmly yet\nThan Ráma's is on justice set.\nHow shall I say, Go forth, and brook\nUpon my Ráma's face to look,\nSee his pale cheek and ashy lips\nDimmed like the moon in sad eclipse?\nHow see the plan so well prepared\nWhen prudent friends my counsels shared,\nAll ruined, like a host laid low\nBeneath some foeman's murderous blow.\nWhat will these gathered princes say,\nFrom regions near and far away?\n“O'erlong endures the monarch's reign,\nor now he is a child again.”\nWhen many a good and holy sage\nIn Scripture versed, revered for age,\nShall ask for Ráma, what shall I\nUnhappy, what shall I reply?\n“By Queen Kaikeyí long distressed\nI drove him forth and dispossessed.”\nAlthough herein the truth I speak,\nThey all will hold me false and weak.\nWhat will Kauśalyá say when she\nDemands her son exiled by me?\nAlas! what answer shall I frame,\nOr how console the injured dame?\nShe like a slave on me attends,\nAnd with a sister's care she blends\nA mother's love, a wife's, a friend's.\nIn spite of all her tender care,\nHer noble son, her face most fair,\nAnother queen I could prefer\nAnd for thy sake neglected her,\nBut now, O Queen, my heart is grieved\nFor love and care by thee received,\nE'en as the sickening wretch repents\nHis dainty meal and condiments.\nAnd how will Queen Sumitrá trust\nThe husband whom she finds unjust,\nSeeing my Ráma driven hence\nDishonoured, and for no offence?\nAh! the Videhan bride will hear\nA double woe, a double fear,\nTwo whelming sorrows at one breath,\nHer lord's disgrace, his father's death.\nMine aged bosom she will wring\nAnd kill me with her sorrowing,\nSad as a fair nymph left to weep\nDeserted on Himálaya's steep.\nFor short will be my days, I ween,\nWhen I with mournful eyes have seen\nMy Ráma wandering forth alone\nAnd heard dear Sítá sob and moan.\nAh me! my fond belief I rue.\nVile traitress, loved as good and true,\nAs one who in his thirst has quaffed,\nDeceived by looks, a deadly draught.\nAh! thou hast slain me, murderess, while\nSoothing my soul with words of guile,\nAs the wild hunter kills the deer\nLured from the brake his song to hear.\nSoon every honest tongue will fling\nReproach on the dishonest king;\nThe people's scorn in every street\nThe seller of his child will meet,\nAnd such dishonour will be mine\nAs whelms a Bráhman drunk with wine.\nAh me, for my unhappy fate,\nCompelled thy words to tolerate!\nSuch woe is sent to scourge a crime\nCommitted in some distant time.\nFor many a day with sinful care\nI cherished thee, thou sin and snare,\nKept thee, unwitting, like a cord\nDestined to bind its hapless lord.\nMine hours of ease I spent with thee,\nNor deemed my love my death would be,\nWhile like a heedless child I played,\nOn a black snake my hand I laid.\nA cry from every mouth will burst\nAnd all the world will hold me curst,\nBecause I saw my high-souled son\nUnkinged, unfathered, and undone;\n“The king by power of love beguiled\nIs weaker than a foolish child,\nHis own beloved son to make\nAn exile for a woman's sake.\nBy chaste and holy vows restrained,\nBy reverend teachers duly trained.\nWhen he his virtue's fruit should taste\nHe falls by sin and woe disgraced.”\nTwo words will all his answer be\nWhen I pronounce the stern decree,\n“Hence, Ráma, to the woods away,”\nAll he will say is, I obey.\nO, if he would my will withstand\nWhen banished from his home and land,\nThis were a comfort in my woe;\nBut he will ne'er do this, I know.\nMy Ráma to the forest fled,\nAnd curses thick upon my head,\nGrim Death will bear me hence away,\nHis world-abominated prey.\nWhen I am gone and Ráma too.\nHow wilt thou those I love pursue?\nWhat vengeful sin will be designed\nAgainst the queens I leave behind?\nWhen thou hast slain her son and me\nKauśalyá soon will follow: she\nWill sink beneath her sorrows' weight,\nAnd die like me disconsolate.\nExist, Kaikeyí, in thy pride,\nAnd let thy heart be gratified,\nWhen thou my queens and me hast hurled,\nAnd children, to the under world.\nSoon wilt thou rule as empress o'er\nMy noble house unvext before.\nBut then to wild confusion left,\nOf Ráma and of me bereft.\nIf Bharat to thy plan consent\nAnd long for Ráma's banishment,\nNe'er let his hands presume to pay\nThe funeral honours to my clay.\nVile foe, thou cause of all mine ill,\nObtain at last thy cursed will.\nA widow soon shalt thou enjoy\nThe sweets of empire with thy boy.\nO Princess, sure some evil fate\nFirst brought thee here to devastate,\nIn whom the night of ruin lies\nVeiled in a consort's fair disguise.\nThe scorn of all and deepest shame\nWill long pursue my hated name,\nAnd dire disgrace on me will press,\nMisled by thee to wickedness.\nHow shall my Ráma, whom, before,\nHis elephant or chariot bore,\nNow with his feet, a wanderer, tread\nThe forest wilds around him spread?\nHow shall my son, to please whose taste,\nThe deftest cooks, with earrings graced,\nWith rivalry and jealous care\nThe dainty meal and cates prepare—\nHow shall he now his life sustain\nWith acid fruit and woodland grain?\nHe spends his time unvext by cares,\nAnd robes of precious texture wears:\nHow shall he, with one garment round\nHis limbs recline upon the ground?\nWhose was this plan, this cruel thought\nUnheard till now, with ruin fraught,\nTo make thy son Ayodhyá's king,\nAnd send my Ráma wandering?\nShame, shame on women! Vile, untrue,\nTheir selfish ends they still pursue.\nNot all of womankind I mean.\nBut more than all this wicked queen.\nO worthless, cruel, selfish dame,\nI brought thee home, my plague and woe.\nWhat fault in me hast thou to blame,\nOr in my son who loves thee so?\nFond wives may from their husbands flee,\nAnd fathers may their sons desert,\nBut all the world would rave to see\nMy Ráma touched with deadly hurt.\nI joy his very step to hear,\nAs though his godlike form I viewed;\nAnd when I see my Ráma near\nI feel my youth again renewed.\nThere might be life without the sun,\nYea, e'en if Indra sent no rain,\nBut, were my Ráma banished, none\nWould, so I think, alive remain.\nA foe that longs my life to take,\nI brought thee here my death to be,\nCaressed thee long, a venomed snake,\nAnd through my folly die. Ah me!\nRáma and me and Lakshmaṇ slay,\nAnd then with Bharat rule the state;\nSo bring the kingdom to decay,\nAnd fawn on those thy lord who hate,\nPlotter of woe, for evil bred,\nFor such a speech why do not all\nThy teeth from out thy wicked head\nSplit in a thousand pieces fall?\nMy Ráma's words are ever kind,\nHe knows not how to speak in ire:\nThen how canst thou presume to find\nA fault in him whom all admire?\nYield to despair, go mad, or die,\nOr sink within the rifted earth;\nThy fell request will I deny,\nThou shamer of thy royal birth.\nThy longer life I scarce can bear,\nThou ruin of my home and race,\nWho wouldst my heart and heartstrings tear,\nKeen as a razor, false and base.\nMy life is gone, why speak of joy?\nFor what, without my son, were sweet?\nSpare, lady, him thou canst destroy;\nI pray thee as I touch thy feet.”\nHe fell and wept with wild complaint,\nHeart-struck by her presumptuous speech,\nBut could not touch, so weak and faint,\nThe cruel feet he strove to reach.</code>"

Why so sore afraid?\nKeep still thy word. The righteous deem\nThat truth, mid duties, is supreme:\nAnd now in truth and honour's name\nI bid thee own the binding claim.\nŚaivya, a king whom earth obeyed,\nOnce to a hawk a promise made,\nGave to the bird his flesh and bone,\nAnd by his truth made heaven his own. \nAlarka, when a Bráhman famed\nFor Scripture lore his promise claimed,\nTore from his head his bleeding eyes\nAnd unreluctant gave the prize.\nHis narrow bounds prescribed restrain\nThe Rivers' Lord, the mighty main,\nWho, though his waters boil and rave,\nKeeps faithful to the word he gave.\nTruth all religion comprehends,\nThrough all the world its might extends:\nIn truth alone is justice placed,\nOn truth the words of God are based:\nA life in truth unchanging past\nWill bring the highest bliss at last.\nIf thou the right would still pursue,\nBe constant to thy word and true:\nLet me thy promise fruitful see,\nFor boons, O King, proceed from thee.\nNow to preserve thy righteous fame,\nAnd yielding to my earnest claim—\nThrice I repeat it—send thy child,\nThy Ráma, to the forest wild.\nBut if the boon thou still deny,\nBefore thy face, forlorn, I die.”\nThus was the helpless monarch stung\nBy Queen Kaikeyí's fearless tongue,\nAs Bali strove in vain to loose\nHis limbs from Indra's fatal noose.\nDismayed in soul and pale with fear,\nThe monarch, like a trembling steer\nBetween the chariot's wheel and yoke,\nAgain to Queen Kaikeyí spoke,\nWith sad eyes fixt in vacant stare,\nGathering courage from despair:\n“That hand I took, thou sinful dame,\nWith texts, before the sacred flame,\nThee and thy son, I scorn and hate,\nAnd all at once repudiate.\nThe night is fled: the dawn is near:\nSoon will the holy priests be here\nTo bid me for the rite prepare\nThat with my son the throne will share,\nThe preparation made to grace\nMy Ráma in his royal place—\nWith this, e'en this, my darling for\nMy death the funeral flood shall pour.\nThou and thy son at least forbear\nIn offerings to my shade to share,\nFor by the plot thy guile has laid\nHis consecration will be stayed.\nThis very day how shall I brook\nTo meet each subject's altered look?\nTo mark each gloomy joyless brow\nThat was so bright and glad but now?”\nWhile thus the high-souled monarch spoke\nTo the stern queen, the Morning broke,\nAnd holy night had slowly fled,\nWith moon and stars engarlanded.\nYet once again the cruel queen\nSpoke words in answer fierce and keen,\nStill on her evil purpose bent,\nWild with her rage and eloquent:\n“What speech is this? Such words as these\nSeem sprung from poison-sown disease.\nQuick to thy noble Ráma send\nAnd bid him on his sire attend.\nWhen to my son the rule is given;\nWhen Ráma to the woods is driven;\nWhen not a rival copes with me,\nFrom chains of duty thou art free.”\nThus goaded, like a generous steed\nUrged by sharp spurs to double speed,\n“My senses are astray,” he cried,\n“And duty's bonds my hands have tied.\nI long to see mine eldest son,\nMy virtuous, my beloved one.”\nAnd now the night had past away;\nOut shone the Maker of the Day,\nBringing the planetary hour\nAnd moment of auspicious power.\nVaśishṭha, virtuous, far renowned,\nWhose young disciples girt him round,\nWith sacred things without delay\nThrough the fair city took his way.\nHe traversed, where the people thronged,\nAnd all for Ráma's coming longed,\nThe town as fair in festive show\nAs his who lays proud cities low. \nHe reached the palace where he heard\nThe mingled notes of many a bird,\nWhere crowded thick high-honoured bands\nOf guards with truncheons in their hands.\nBegirt by many a sage, elate,\nVaśishṭha reached the royal gate,\nAnd standing by the door he found\nSumantra, for his form renowned,\nThe king's illustrious charioteer\nAnd noble counsellor and peer.\nTo him well skilled in every part\nOf his hereditary art\nVaśishṭha said: “O charioteer,\nInform the king that I am here,\nHere ready by my side behold\nThese sacred vessels made of gold,\nWhich water for the rite contain\nFrom Gangá and each distant main.\nHere for installing I have brought\nThe seat prescribed of fig-wood wrought,\nAll kinds of seed and precious scent\nAnd many a gem and ornament;\nGrain, sacred grass, the garden's spoil,\nHoney and curds and milk and oil;\nEight radiant maids, the best of all\nWar elephants that feed in stall;\nA four-horse car, a bow and sword.\nA litter, men to bear their lord;\nA white umbrella bright and fair\nThat with the moon may well compare;\nTwo chouries of the whitest hair;\nA golden beaker rich and rare;\nA bull high-humped and fair to view,\nGirt with gold bands and white of hue;\nA four-toothed steed with flowing mane,\nA throne which lions carved sustain;\nA tiger's skin, the sacred fire,\nFresh kindled, which the rites require;\nThe best musicians skilled to play,\nAnd dancing-girls in raiment gay;\nKine, Bráhmans, teachers fill the court,\nAnd bird and beast of purest sort.\nFrom town and village, far and near,\nThe noblest men are gathered here;\nHere merchants with their followers crowd,\nAnd men in joyful converse loud,\nAnd kings from many a distant land\nTo view the consecration stand.\nThe dawn is come, the lucky day;\nGo bid the monarch haste away,\nThat now Prince Ráma may obtain\nThe empire, and begin his reign.”\nSoon as he heard the high behest\nThe driver of the chariot pressed\nWithin the chambers of the king,\nHis lord with praises honouring.\nAnd none of all the warders checked\nHis entrance for their great respect\nOf him well known, in place so high,\nStill fain their king to gratify.\nHe stood beside the royal chief,\nUnwitting of his deadly grief,\nAnd with sweet words began to sing\nThe praises of his lord and king:\n“As, when the sun begins to rise,\nThe sparkling sea delights our eyes,\nWake, calm with gentle soul, and thus\nGive rapture, mighty King, to us.\nAs Mátali  this selfsame hour\nSang lauds of old to Indra's power,\nWhen he the Titan hosts o'erthrew,\nSo hymn I thee with praises due.\nThe Vedas, with their kindred lore,\nBrahmá their soul-born Lord adore,\nWith all the doctrines of the wise,\nAnd bid him, as I bid thee, rise.\nAs, with the moon, the Lord of Day\nWakes with the splendour of his ray\nProlific Earth, who neath him lies,\nSo, mighty King, I bid thee rise.\nWith blissful words, O Lord of men,\nRise, radiant in thy form, as when\nThe sun ascending darts his light\nFrom Meru's everlasting height.\nMay Śiva, Agni, Sun, and Moon\nBestow on thee each choicest boon,\nKuvera, Varuṇa, Indra bless\nKakutstha's son with all success.\nAwake, the holy night is fled,\nThe happy light abroad is spread;\nAwake, O best of kings, and share\nThe glorious task that claims thy care.\nThe holy sage Vaśishṭha waits,\nWith all his Bráhmans, at the gate.\nGive thy decree, without delay,\nTo consecrate thy son today.\nAs armies, by no captain led,\nAs flocks that feed unshepherded,\nSuch is the fortune of a state\nWithout a king and desolate.”\nSuch were the words the bard addressed,\nWith weight of sage advice impressed;\nAnd, as he heard, the hapless king\nFelt deeper yet his sorrow's sting.\nAt length, all joy and comfort fled,\nHe raised his eyes with weeping red,\nAnd, mournful for his Ráma's sake,\nThe good and glorious monarch spake:\n“Why seek with idle praise to greet\nThe wretch for whom no praise is meet?\nThy words mine aching bosom tear,\nAnd plunge me deeper in despair.”\nSumantra heard the sad reply,\nAnd saw his master's tearful eye.\nWith reverent palm to palm applied\nHe drew a little space aside.\nThen, as the king, with misery weak,\nWith vain endeavour strove to speak,\nKaikeyí, skilled in plot and plan,\nTo sage Sumantra thus began:\n“The king, absorbed in joyful thought\nFor his dear son, no rest has sought:\nSleepless to him the night has past,\nAnd now o'erwatched he sinks at last.\nThen go, Sumantra, and with speed\nThe glorious Ráma hither lead:\nGo, as I pray, nor longer wait;\nNo time is this to hesitate.”\n“How can I go, O Lady fair,\nUnless my lord his will declare?”\n“Fain would I see him,” cried the king,\n“Quick, quick, my beauteous Ráma bring.”\nThen rose the happy thought to cheer\nThe bosom of the charioteer,\n“The king, I ween, of pious mind,\nThe consecration has designed.”\nSumantra for his wisdom famed,\nDelighted with the thought he framed,\nFrom the calm chamber, like a bay\nOf crowded ocean, took his way.\nHe turned his face to neither side,\nBut forth he hurried straight;\nOnly a little while he eyed\nThe guards who kept the gate.\nHe saw in front a gathered crowd\nOf men of every class,\nWho, parting as he came, allowed\nThe charioteer to pass.</code>"

Be messengers despatched\nOn coursers ne'er for fleetness matched,\nTo seek my father's home and lead\nMy Bharat back with all their speed.\nAnd, Ráma, as I ween that thou\nWilt scarce endure to linger now,\nSo surely it were wise and good\nThis hour to journey to the wood.\nAnd if, with shame cast down and weak,\nNo word to thee the king can speak,\nForgive, and from thy mind dismiss\nA trifle in an hour like this.\nBut till thy feet in rapid haste\nHave left the city for the waste,\nAnd to the distant forest fled,\nHe will not bathe nor call for bread.”\n“Woe! woe!” from the sad monarch burst,\nIn surging floods of grief immersed;\nThen swooning, with his wits astray,\nUpon the gold-wrought couch he lay,\nAnd Ráma raised the aged king:\nBut the stern queen, unpitying,\nChecked not her needless words, nor spared\nThe hero for all speed prepared,\nBut urged him with her bitter tongue,\nLike a good horse with lashes stung,\nShe spoke her shameful speech. Serene\nHe heard the fury of the queen,\nAnd to her words so vile and dread\nGently, unmoved in mind, he said:\n“I would not in this world remain\nA grovelling thrall to paltry gain,\nBut duty's path would fain pursue,\nTrue as the saints themselves are true.\nFrom death itself I would not fly\nMy father's wish to gratify,\nWhat deed soe'er his loving son\nMay do to please him, think it done.\nAmid all duties, Queen, I count\nThis duty first and paramount,\nThat sons, obedient, aye fulfil\nTheir honoured fathers' word and will.\nWithout his word, if thou decree,\nForth to the forest will I flee,\nAnd there shall fourteen years be spent\nMid lonely wilds in banishment.\nMethinks thou couldst not hope to find\nOne spark of virtue in my mind,\nIf thou, whose wish is still my lord,\nHast for this grace the king implored.\nThis day I go, but, ere we part,\nMust cheer my Sítá's tender heart,\nTo my dear mother bid farewell;\nThen to the woods, a while to dwell.\nWith thee, O Queen, the care must rest\nThat Bharat hear his sire's behest,\nAnd guard the land with righteous sway,\nFor such the law that lives for aye.”\nIn speechless woe the father heard,\nWept with loud cries, but spoke no word.\nThen Ráma touched his senseless feet,\nAnd hers, for honour most unmeet;\nRound both his circling steps he bent,\nThen from the bower the hero went.\nSoon as he reached the gate he found\nHis dear companions gathered round.\nBehind him came Sumitrá's child\nWith weeping eyes so sad and wild.\nThen saw he all that rich array\nOf vases for the glorious day.\nRound them with reverent stops he paced,\nNor vailed his eye, nor moved in haste.\nThe loss of empire could not dim\nThe glory that encompassed him.\nSo will the Lord of Cooling Rays \nOn whom the world delights to gaze,\nThrough the great love of all retain\nSweet splendour in the time of wane.\nNow to the exile's lot resigned\nHe left the rule of earth behind:\nAs though all worldly cares he spurned\nNo trouble was in him discerned.\nThe chouries that for kings are used,\nAnd white umbrella, he refused,\nDismissed his chariot and his men,\nAnd every friend and citizen.\nHe ruled his senses, nor betrayed\nThe grief that on his bosom weighed,\nAnd thus his mother's mansion sought\nTo tell the mournful news he brought.\nNor could the gay-clad people there\nWho flocked round Ráma true and fair,\nOne sign of altered fortune trace\nUpon the splendid hero's face.\nNor had the chieftain, mighty-armed,\nLost the bright look all hearts that charmed,\nAs e'en from autumn moons is thrown\nA splendour which is all their own.\nWith his sweet voice the hero spoke\nSaluting all the gathered folk,\nThen righteous-souled and great in fame\nClose to his mother's house he came.\nLakshmaṇ the brave, his brother's peer\nIn princely virtues, followed near,\nSore troubled, but resolved to show\nNo token of his secret woe.\nThus to the palace Ráma went\nWhere all were gay with hope and joy;\nBut well he knew the dire event\nThat hope would mar, that bliss destroy.\nSo to his grief he would not yield\nLest the sad change their hearts might rend,\nAnd, the dread tiding unrevealed,\nSpared from the blow each faithful friend.</code>"

He took the proffered seat,\nAnd as she pressed her son to eat,\nRaised reverent bands, and, touched with shame,\nMade answer to the royal dame:\n“Dear lady, thou hast yet to know\nThat danger threats, and heavy woe:\nA grief that will with sore distress\nOn Sítá, thee, and Lakshmaṇ press.\nWhat need of seats have such as I?\nThis day to Daṇḍak wood I fly.\nThe hour is come, a time, unmeet\nFor silken couch and gilded seat.\nI must to lonely wilds repair,\nAbstain from flesh, and living there\nOn roots, fruit, honey, hermit's food,\nPass twice seven years in solitude.\nTo Bharat's hand the king will yield\nThe regent power I thought to wield,\nAnd me, a hermit, will he send\nMy days in Daṇḍak wood to spend.”\nAs when the woodman's axe has lopped\nA Śal branch in the grove, she dropped:\nSo from the skies a Goddess falls\nEjected from her radiant halls.\nWhen Ráma saw her lying low,\nProstrate by too severe a blow,\nAround her form his arms he wound\nAnd raised her fainting from the ground.\nHis hand upheld her like a mare\nWho feels her load too sore to bear,\nAnd sinks upon the way o'ertoiled,\nAnd all her limbs with dust are soiled.\nHe soothed her in her wild distress\nWith loving touch and soft caress.\nShe, meet for highest fortune, eyed\nThe hero watching by her side,\nAnd thus, while Lakshmaṇ bent to hear,\nAddressed her son with many a tear!\n“If, Ráma, thou had ne'er been born\nMy child to make thy mother mourn,\nThough reft of joy, a childless queen,\nSuch woe as this I ne'er had seen.\nThough to the childless wife there clings\nOne sorrow armed with keenest stings,\n“No child have I: no child have I,”\nNo second misery prompts the sigh.\nWhen long I sought, alas, in vain,\nMy husband's love and bliss to gain,\nIn Ráma all my hopes I set\nAnd dreamed I might be happy yet.\nI, of the consorts first and best,\nMust bear my rivals' taunt and jest,\nAnd brook, though better far than they,\nThe soul distressing words they say.\nWhat woman can be doomed to pine\nIn misery more sore than mine,\nWhose hopeless days must still be spent\nIn grief that ends not and lament?\nThey scorned me when my son was nigh;\nWhen he is banished I must die.\nMe, whom my husband never prized,\nKaikeyí's retinue despised\nWith boundless insolence, though she\nTops not in rank nor equals me.\nAnd they who do me service yet,\nNor old allegiance quite forget,\nWhene'er they see Kaikeyí's son,\nWith silent lips my glances shun.\nHow, O my darling, shall I brook\nEach menace of Kaikeyí's look,\nAnd listen, in my low estate,\nTo taunts of one so passionate?\nFor seventeen years since thou wast born\nI sat and watched, ah me, forlorn!\nHoping some blessed day to see\nDeliverance from my woes by thee.\nNow comes this endless grief and wrong,\nSo dire I cannot bear it long,\nSinking, with age and sorrow worn,\nBeneath my rivals' taunts and scorn.\nHow shall I pass in dark distress\nMy long lone days of wretchedness\nWithout my Ráma's face, as bright\nAs the full moon to cheer my sight?\nAlas, my cares thy steps to train,\nAnd fasts, and vows, and prayers are vain.\nHard, hard, I ween, must be this heart\nTo hear this blow nor burst apart,\nAs some great river bank, when first\nThe floods of Rain-time on it burst.\nNo, Fate that speeds not will not slay,\nNor Yama's halls vouchsafe me room,\nOr, like a lion's weeping prey,\nDeath now had borne me to my doom.\nHard is my heart and wrought of steel\nThat breaks not with the crushing blow,\nOr in the pangs this day I feel\nMy lifeless frame had sunk below.\nDeath waits his hour, nor takes me now:\nBut this sad thought augments my pain,\nThat prayer and largess, fast and vow,\nAnd Heavenward service are in vain.\nAh me, ah me! with fruitless toil\nOf rites austere a child I sought:\nThus seed cast forth on barren soil\nStill lifeless lies and comes to naught.\nIf ever wretch by anguish grieved\nBefore his hour to death had fled,\nI mourning, like a cow bereaved,\nHad been this day among the dead.”</code>"

with blood be dyed\nOf those who stand on Bharat's side:\nNone shall my slaughtering hand exempt,\nFor gentle patience earns contempt.\nIf, by Kaikeyí's counsel changed,\nOur father's heart be thus estranged,\nNo mercy must our arm restrain,\nBut let the foe be slain, be slain.\nFor should the guide, respected long,\nNo more discerning right and wrong,\nTurn in forbidden paths to stray,\n'Tis meet that force his steps should stay.\nWhat power sufficient can he see,\nWhat motive for the wish has he,\nThat to Kaikeyí would resign\nThe empire which is justly thine?\nCan he, O conqueror of thy foes,\nThy strength and mine in war oppose?\nCan he entrust, in our despite,\nTo Bharat's hand thy royal right?\nI love this brother with the whole\nAffection of my faithful soul.\nYea Queen, by bow and truth I swear,\nBy sacrifice, and gift, and prayer,\nIf Ráma to the forest goes,\nOr where the burning furnace glows,\nFirst shall my feet the forest tread,\nThe flames shall first surround my head.\nMy might shall chase thy grief and tears,\nAs darkness flies when morn appears.\nDo thou, dear Queen, and Ráma too\nBehold what power like mine can do.\nMy aged father I will kill,\nThe vassal of Kaikeyí's will,\nOld, yet a child, the woman's thrall,\nInfirm, and base, the scorn of all.”\nThus Lakshmaṇ cried, the mighty-souled:\nDown her sad cheeks the torrents rolled,\nAs to her son Kauśalyá spake:\n“Now thou hast heard thy brother, take\nHis counsel if thou hold it wise,\nAnd do the thing his words advise,\nDo not, my son, with tears I pray,\nMy rival's wicked word obey,\nLeave me not here consumed with woe,\nNor to the wood, an exile, go.\nIf thou, to virtue ever true,\nThy duty's path would still pursue,\nThe highest duty bids thee stay\nAnd thus thy mother's voice obey.\nThus Kaśyap's great ascetic son\nA seat among the Immortals won:\nIn his own home, subdued, he stayed,\nAnd honour to his mother paid.\nIf reverence to thy sire be due,\nThy mother claims like honour too,\nAnd thus I charge thee, O my child,\nThou must not seek the forest wild.\nAh, what to me were life and bliss,\nCondemned my darling son to miss?\nBut with my Ráma near, to eat\nThe very grass itself were sweet.\nBut if thou still wilt go and leave\nThy hapless mother here to grieve,\nI from that hour will food abjure,\nNor life without my son endure.\nThen it will be thy fate to dwell\nIn depth of world-detested hell.\nAs Ocean in the olden time\nWas guilty of an impious crime\nThat marked the lord of each fair flood\nAs one who spills a Bráhman's blood.” \nThus spake the queen, and wept, and sighed:\nThen righteous Ráma thus replied:\n“I have no power to slight or break\nCommandments which my father spake.\nI bend my head, dear lady, low,\nForgive me, for I needs must go.\nOnce Kaṇdu, mighty saint, who made\nHis dwelling in the forest shade,\nA cow—and duty's claims he knew—\nObedient to his father, slew.\nAnd in the line from which we spring,\nWhen ordered by their sire the king,\nThrough earth the sons of Sagar cleft,\nAnd countless things of life bereft. \nSo Jamadagní's son  obeyed\nHis sire, when in the wood he laid\nHis hand upon his axe, and smote\nThrough Renuká his mother's throat.\nThe deeds of these and more beside.\nPeers of the Gods, my steps shall guide,\nAnd resolute will I fulfil\nMy father's word, my father's will.\nNor I, O Queen, unsanctioned tread\nThis righteous path, by duty led:\nThe road my footsteps journey o'er\nWas traversed by the great of yore.\nThis high command which all accept\nShall faithfully by me be kept,\nFor duty ne'er will him forsake\nWho fears his sire's command to break.”\nThus to his mother wild with grief:\nThen thus to Lakshmaṇ spake the chief\nOf those by whom the bow is bent,\nMid all who speak, most eloquent:\n“I know what love for me thou hast,\nWhat firm devotion unsurpassed:\nThy valour and thy worth I know,\nAnd glory that appals the foe.\nBlest youth, my mother's woe is great,\nIt bends her 'neath its matchless weight:\nNo claims will she, with blinded eyes,\nOf truth and patience recognize.\nFor duty is supreme in place,\nAnd truth is duty's noblest base.\nObedient to my sire's behest\nI serve the cause of duty best.\nFor man should truly do whate'er\nTo mother, Bráhman, sire, he sware:\nHe must in duty's path remain,\nNor let his word be pledged in vain.\nAnd, O my brother, how can I\nObedience to this charge deny?\nKaikeyí's tongue my purpose spurred,\nBut 'twas my sire who gave the word.\nCast these unholy thoughts aside\nWhich smack of war and Warriors' pride;\nTo duty's call, not wrath attend,\nAnd tread the path which I commend.”\nRáma by fond affection moved\nHis brother Lakshmaṇ thus reproved;\nThen with joined hands and reverent head\nAgain to Queen Kauśalyá said:\n“I needs must go—do thou consent—\nTo the wild wood in banishment.\nO give me, by my life I pray,\nThy blessing ere I go away.\nI, when the promised years are o'er,\nShall see Ayodhyá's town once more.\nThen, mother dear, thy tears restrain,\nNor let thy heart be wrung by pain:\nIn time, my father's will obeyed,\nShall I return from greenwood shade.\nMy dear Videhan, thou, and I,\nLakshmaṇ, Sumitrá, feel this tie,\nAnd must my father's word obey,\nAs duty bids that rules for aye.\nThy preparations now forgo,\nAnd lock within thy breast thy woe,\nNor be my pious wish withstood\nTo go an exile to the wood.”\nCalm and unmoved the prince explained\nHis duty's claim and purpose high,\nThe mother life and sense regained,\nLooked on her son and made reply:\n“If reverence be thy father's due,\nThe same by right and love is mine:\nGo not, my charge I thus renew,\nNor leave me here in woe to pine,\nWhat were such lonely life to me,\nRites to the shades, or deathless lot?\nMore dear, my son, one hour with thee\nThan all the world where thou art not.”\nAs bursts to view, when brands blaze high,\nSome elephant concealed by night,\nSo, when he heard his mother's cry,\nBurnt Ráma's grief with fiercer might.\nThus to the queen, half senseless still,\nAnd Lakshmaṇ, burnt with heart-felt pain,\nTrue to the right, with steadfast will,\nHis duteous speech he spoke again:\n“Brother, I know thy loving mind,\nThy valour and thy truth I know,\nBut now to claims of duty blind\nThou and my mother swell my woe.\nThe fruits of deeds in human life\nMake love, gain, duty, manifest,\nDear when they meet as some fond wife\nWith her sweet babes upon her breast.\nBut man to duty first should turn\nWhene'er the three are not combined:\nFor those who heed but gain we spurn,\nAnd those to pleasure all resigned.\nShall then the virtuous disobey\nHosts of an aged king and sire,\nThough feverous joy that father sway,\nOr senseless love or causeless ire?\nI have no power, commanded thus,\nTo slight his promise and decree:\nThe honoured sire of both of us,\nMy mother's lord and life is he.\nShall she, while yet the holy king\nIs living, on the right intent,—\nShall she, like some poor widowed thing,\nGo forth with me to banishment?\nNow, mother, speed thy parting son,\nAnd let thy blessing soothe my pain,\nThat I may turn, mine exile done,\nLike King Yayáti, home again.\nFair glory and the fruit she gives,\nFor lust of sway I ne'er will slight:\nWhat, for the span a mortal lives.\nWere rule of faith without the right?”\nHe soothed her thus, firm to the last\nHis counsel to his brother told:\nThen round the queen in reverence passed,\nAnd held her in his loving hold.</code>"

bent\nHis brows that chief most excellent,\nAnd like a serpent in his hole,\nBreathed fierce and fast in wrath of soul.\nHis threatening brows so darkly frowned,\nHis eyes so fiercely glanced around,\nThey made his glare, which none might brook,\nLike some infuriate lion's look.\nLike some wild elephant, full oft\nHe raised and shook his hand  aloft.\nNow turned his neck to left and right\nNow bent, now raised its stately height.\nNow in his rage that sword he felt\nWhich mangling wounds to foemen dealt,\nWith sidelong glance his brother eyed,\nAnd thus in burning words replied:\n“Thy rash resolve, thy eager haste,\nThy mighty fear, are all misplaced:\nNo room is here for duty's claim,\nNo cause to dread the people's blame.\nCan one as brave as thou consent\nTo use a coward's argument?\nThe glory of the Warrior race\nWith craven speech his lips debase?\nCan one like thee so falsely speak,\nExalting Fate, confessed so weak?\nCanst thou, undoubting still restrain?\nSuspicions of those sinful twain?\nCanst thou, most duteous, fail to know\nTheir hearts are set on duty's show?\nThey with deceit have set their trains,\nAnd now the fruit rewards their pains.\nHad they not long ago agreed,\nO Ráma, on this treacherous deed,\nThat promised boon, so long retained,\nHe erst had given and she had gained.\nI cannot, O my brother, bear\nTo see another throned as heir\nWith rites which all our people hate:\nThen, O, this passion tolerate.\nThis vaunted duty which can guide\nThy steps from wisdom's path aside,\nAnd change the counsel of thy breast,\nO lofty-hearted, I detest.\nWilt thou, when power and might are thine,\nSubmit to this abhorred design?\nThy father's impious hest fulfil,\nThat vassal of Kaikeyí's will?\nBut if thou still wilt shut thine eyes,\nNor see the guile herein that lies,\nMy soul is sad, I deeply mourn,\nAnd duty seems a thing to scorn.\nCanst thou one moment think to please\nThis pair who live for love and ease,\nAnd 'gainst thy peace, as foes, allied,\nWith tenderest names their hatred hide?\nNow if thy judgment still refers\nTo Fate this plot of his and hers,\nMy mind herein can ne'er agree:\nAnd O, in this be ruled by me.\nWeak, void of manly pride are they\nWho bend to Fate's imputed sway:\nThe choicest souls, the nobly great\nDisdain to bow their heads to Fate.\nAnd he who dares his Fate control\nWith vigorous act and manly soul,\nThough threatening Fate his hopes assail,\nUnmoved through all need never quail.\nThis day mankind shall learn aright\nThe power of Fate and human might,\nSo shall the gulf that lies between\nA man and Fate be clearly seen.\nThe might of Fate subdued by me\nThis hour the citizens shall see,\nWho saw its intervention stay\nThy consecrating rites to-day.\nMy power shall turn this Fate aside,\nThat threatens, as, with furious stride,\nAn elephant who scorns to feel,\nIn rage unchecked, the driver's steel.\nNot the great Lords whose sleepless might\nProtects the worlds, shall stay the rite\nThough earth, hell, heaven combine their powers:\nAnd shall we fear this sire of ours?\nThen if their minds are idly bent\nTo doom thee, King, to banishment,\nThrough twice seven years of exile they\nShall in the lonely forest stay.\nI will consume the hopes that fire\nThe queen Kaikeyí and our sire,\nThat to her son this check will bring\nAdvantage, making Bharat king.\nThe power of Fate will ne'er withstand\nThe might that arms my vigorous hand;\nIf danger and distress assail,\nMy fearless strength will still prevail.\nA thousand circling years shall flee:\nThe forest then thy home shall be,\nAnd thy good sons, succeeding, hold\nThe empire which their sire controlled.\nThe royal saints, of old who reigned,\nFor aged kings this rest ordained:\nThese to their sons their realm commit\nThat they, like sires, may cherish it.\nO pious soul, if thou decline\nThe empire which is justly thine,\nLest, while the king distracted lies,\nDisorder in the state should rise,\nI,—or no mansion may I find\nIn worlds to hero souls assigned,—\nThe guardian of thy realm will be,\nAs the sea-bank protects the sea.\nThen cast thine idle fears aside:\nWith prosperous rites be sanctified.\nThe lords of earth may strive in vain:\nMy power shall all their force restrain.\nMy pair of arms, my warrior's bow\nAre not for pride or empty show:\nFor no support these shafts were made;\nAnd binding up ill suits my blade:\nTo pierce the foe with deadly breach—\nThis is the work of all and each.\nBut small, methinks the love I show\nFor him I count my mortal foe.\nSoon as my trenchant steel is bare,\nFlashing its lightning through the air,\nI heed no foe, nor stand aghast\nThough Indra's self the levin cast.\nThen shall the ways be hard to pass,\nWhere chariots lie in ruinous mass;\nWhen elephant and man and steed\nCrushed in the murderous onslaught bleed,\nAnd legs and heads fall, heap on heap,\nBeneath my sword's tremendous sweep.\nStruck by my keen brand's trenchant blade,\nThine enemies shall fall dismayed,\nLike towering mountains rent in twain,\nOr lightning clouds that burst in rain.\nWhen armed with brace and glove I stand,\nAnd take my trusty bow in hand,\nWho then shall vaunt his might? who dare\nCount him a man to meet me there?\nThen will I loose my shafts, and strike\nMan, elephant, and steed alike:\nAt one shall many an arrow fly,\nAnd many a foe with one shall die.\nThis day the world my power shall see,\nThat none in arms can rival me:\nMy strength the monarch shall abase,\nAnd set thee, lord, in lordliest place.\nThese arms which breathe the sandal's scent,\nWhich golden bracelets ornament,\nThese hands which precious gifts bestow,\nWhich guard the friend and smite the foe,\nA nobler service shall assay,\nAnd fight in Ráma's cause to-day,\nThe robbers of thy rights to stay.\nSpeak, brother, tell thy foeman's name\nWhom I, in conquering strife,\nMay strip of followers and fame,\nOf fortune, or of life.\nSay, how may all this sea-girt land\nBe brought to own thy sway:\nThy faithful servant here I stand\nTo listen and obey.”\nThen strove the bride of Raghu's race\nSad Lakshmaṇ's heart to cheer,\nWhile slowly down the hero's face,\nUnchecked, there rolled a tear.\n“The orders of my sire,” he cried,\n“My will shall ne'er oppose:\nI follow still, whate'er betide,\nThe path which duty shows.”</code>"

let me go\nAnd wander like a woodland roe.”\nThen, while no tear the hero shed,\nThus to the weeping queen he said:\n“Mother, while lives the husband, he\nIs woman's lord and deity.\nO dearest lady, thou and I\nOur lord and king must ne'er deny;\nThe lord of earth himself have we\nOur guardian wise and friend to be.\nAnd Bharat, true to duty's call,\nWhose sweet words take the hearts of all,\nWill serve thee well, and ne'er forget\nThe virtuous path before him set.\nBe this, I pray, thine earnest care,\nThat the old king my father ne'er,\nWhen I have parted hence, may know,\nGrieved for his son, a pang of woe.\nLet not this grief his soul distress,\nTo kill him with the bitterness.\nWith duteous care, in every thing,\nLove, comfort, cheer the aged king.\nThough, best of womankind, a spouse\nKeeps firmly all her fasts and vows,\nNor yet her husband's will obeys,\nShe treads in sin's forbidden ways.\nShe to her husband's will who bends,\nGoes to high bliss that never ends,\nYea, though the Gods have found in her\nNo reverential worshipper.\nBent on his weal, a woman still\nMust seek to do her husband's will:\nFor Scripture, custom, law uphold\nThis duty Heaven revealed of old.\nHonour true Bráhmans for my sake,\nAnd constant offerings duly make,\nWith fire-oblations and with flowers,\nTo all the host of heavenly powers.\nLook to the coming time, and yearn\nFor the glad hour of my return.\nAnd still thy duteous course pursue,\nAbstemious, humble, kind, and true.\nThe highest bliss shalt thou obtain\nWhen I from exile come again,\nIf, best of those who keep the right,\nThe king my sire still see the light.”\nThe queen, by Ráma thus addressed,\nStill with a mother's grief oppressed,\nWhile her long eyes with tears were dim,\nBegan once more and answered him:\n“Not by my pleading may be stayed\nThe firm resolve thy soul has made.\nMy hero, thou wilt go; and none\nThe stern commands of Fate may shun.\nGo forth, dear child whom naught can bend,\nAnd may all bliss thy steps attend.\nThou wilt return, and that dear day\nWill chase mine every grief away.\nThou wilt return, thy duty done,\nThy vows discharged, high glory won;\nFrom filial debt wilt thou be free,\nAnd sweetest joy will come on me.\nMy son, the will of mighty Fate\nAt every time must dominate,\nIf now it drives thee hence to stray\nHeedless of me who bid thee stay.\nGo, strong of arm, go forth, my boy,\nGo forth, again to come with joy,\nAnd thine expectant mother cheer\nWith those sweet tones she loves to hear.\nO that the blessed hour were nigh\nWhen thou shalt glad this anxious eye,\nWith matted hair and hermit dress\nreturning from the wilderness.”\nKauśalyá's conscious soul approved,\nAs her proud glance she bent\nOn Ráma constant and unmoved,\nResolved on banishment.\nSuch words, with happy omens fraught\nTo her dear son she said,\nInvoking with each eager thought\nA blessing on his head.</code>"

hand with slaughter glowed\nOf that dire brood of monstrous size,\nAttend, my child, thine enterprise!\nE'en such as peerless Vishṇu graced,\nWhen with his triple step he paced,\nOutbursting from the dwarf's disguise, \nAttend, my child, thine enterprise!\nFloods, isles, and seasons as they fly,\nWorlds, Vedas, quarters of the sky,\nCombine, O mighty-armed, to bless\nThee destined heir of happiness!”\nThe long-eyed lady ceased: she shed\nPure scent and grain upon his head.\nAnd that prized herb whose sovereign power\nPreserves from dark misfortune's hour,\nUpon the hero's arm she set,\nTo be his faithful amulet.\nWhile holy texts she murmured low,\nAnd spoke glad words though crushed by woe,\nConcealing with obedient tongue\nThe pangs with which her heart was wrung.\nShe bent, she kissed his brow, she pressed\nHer darling to her troubled breast:\n“Firm in thy purpose, go,” she cried,\n“Go Ráma, and may bliss betide.\nAttain returning safe and well,\nTriumphant in Ayodhyá, dwell.\nThen shall my happy eyes behold\nThe empire by thy will controlled.\nThen grief and care shall leave no trace,\nJoy shall light up thy mother's face,\nAnd I shall see my darling reign,\nIn moonlike glory come again.\nThese eyes shall fondly gaze on thee\nSo faithful to thy sire's decree,\nWhen thou the forest wild shalt quit\nOn thine ancestral throne to sit.\nYea, thou shalt turn from exile back,\nNor choicest blessings ever lack,\nThen fill with rapture ever new\nMy bosom and thy consort's too.\nTo Śiva and the heavenly host\nMy worship has been paid,\nTo mighty saint, to godlike ghost,\nTo every wandering shade.\nForth to the forest thou wilt hie,\nTherein to dwell so long:\nLet all the quarters of the sky\nProtect my child from wrong.”\nHer blessings thus the queen bestowed;\nThen round him fondly paced,\nAnd often, while her eyes o'erflowed,\nHer dearest son embraced.\nKauśalyá's honoured feet he pressed,\nAs round her steps she bent,\nAnd radiant with her prayers that blessed,\nTo Sítá's home he went.</code>"

radiance on the way he cast,\nAnd each fair grace, by all approved,\nThe bosoms of the people moved.\nNow of the woeful change no word\nThe fair Videhan bride had heard;\nThe thought of that imperial rite\nStill filled her bosom with delight.\nWith grateful heart and joyful thought\nThe Gods in worship she had sought,\nAnd, well in royal duties learned,\nSat longing till her lord returned,\nNot all unmarked by grief and shame\nWithin his sumptuous home he came,\nAnd hurried through the happy crowd\nWith eye dejected, gloomy-browed.\nUp Sítá sprang, and every limb\nTrembled with fear at sight of him.\nShe marked that cheek where anguish fed,\nThose senses care-disquieted.\nFor, when he looked on her, no more\nCould his heart hide the load it bore,\nNor could the pious chief control\nThe paleness o'er his cheek that stole.\nHis altered cheer, his brow bedewed\nWith clammy drops, his grief she viewed,\nAnd cried, consumed with fires of woe,\n“What, O my lord, has changed thee so?\nVrihaspati looks down benign,\nAnd the moon rests in Pushya's sign,\nAs Bráhmans sage this day declare:\nThen whence, my lord, this grief and care?\nWhy does no canopy, like foam\nFor its white beauty, shade thee home,\nIts hundred ribs spread wide to throw\nSplendour on thy fair head below?\nWhere are the royal fans, to grace\nThe lotus beauty of thy face,\nFair as the moon or wild-swan's wing,\nAnd waving round the new-made king?\nWhy do no sweet-toned bards rejoice\nTo hail thee with triumphant voice?\nNo tuneful heralds love to raise\nLoud music in their monarch's praise?\nWhy do no Bráhmans, Scripture-read,\nPour curds and honey on thy head,\nAnointed, as the laws ordain,\nWith holy rites, supreme to reign?\nWhere are the chiefs of every guild?\nWhere are the myriads should have filled\nThe streets, and followed home their king\nWith merry noise and triumphing?\nWhy does no gold-wrought chariot lead\nWith four brave horses, best for speed?\nNo elephant precede the crowd\nLike a huge hill or thunder cloud,\nMarked from his birth for happy fate,\nWhom signs auspicious decorate?\nWhy does no henchman, young and fair,\nPrecede thee, and delight to bear\nEntrusted to his reverent hold\nThe burthen of thy throne of gold?\nWhy, if the consecrating rite\nBe ready, why this mournful plight?\nWhy do I see this sudden change,\nThis altered mien so sad and strange?”\nTo her, as thus she weeping cried,\nRaghu's illustrious son replied:\n“Sítá, my honoured sire's decree\nCommands me to the woods to flee.\nO high-born lady, nobly bred\nIn the good paths thy footsteps tread,\nHear, Janak's daughter, while I tell\nThe story as it all befell.\nOf old my father true and brave\nTwo boons to Queen Kaikeyí gave.\nThrough these the preparations made\nFor me to-day by her are stayed,\nFor he is bound to disallow\nThis promise by that earlier vow.\nIn Daṇḍak forest wild and vast\nMust fourteen years by me be passed.\nMy father's will makes Bharat heir,\nThe kingdom and the throne to share.\nNow, ere the lonely wild I seek,\nI come once more with thee to speak.\nIn Bharat's presence, O my dame,\nNe'er speak with pride of Ráma's name:\nAnother's eulogy to hear\nIs hateful to a monarch's ear.\nThou must with love his rule obey\nTo whom my father yields the sway.\nWith love and sweet observance learn\nHis grace, and more the king's, to earn.\nNow, that my father may not break\nThe words of promise that he spake,\nTo the drear wood my steps are bent:\nBe firm, good Sítá, and content.\nThrough all that time, my blameless spouse,\nKeep well thy fasts and holy vows.\nRise from thy bed at break of day,\nAnd to the Gods due worship pay.\nWith meek and lowly love revere\nThe lord of men, my father dear,\nAnd reverence to Kauśalyá show,\nMy mother, worn with eld and woe:\nBy duty's law, O best of dames,\nHigh worship from thy love she claims,\nNor to the other queens refuse\nObservance, rendering each her dues:\nBy love and fond attention shown\nThey are my mothers like mine own.\nLet Bharat and Śatrughna bear\nIn thy sweet love a special share:\nDear as my life, O let them be\nLike brother and like son to thee.\nIn every word and deed refrain\nFrom aught that Bharat's soul may pain:\nHe is Ayodhyá's king and mine,\nThe head and lord of all our line.\nFor those who serve and love them much\nWith weariless endeavour, touch\nAnd win the gracious hearts of kings.\nWhile wrath from disobedience springs.\nGreat monarchs from their presence send\nTheir lawful sons who still offend,\nAnd welcome to the vacant place\nGood children of an alien race.\nThen, best of women, rest thou here,\nAnd Bharat's will with love revere.\nObedient to thy king remain,\nAnd still thy vows of truth maintain.\nTo the wide wood my steps I bend:\nMake thou thy dwelling here;\nSee that thy conduct ne'er offend,\nAnd keep my words, my dear.”</code>"

Raghu, sore distressed,\nHis brother's feet with fervour pressed,\nWhile thus to Sítá he complained,\nAnd him by lofty vows enchained:\n“If thou wilt make the woods thy home,\nWhere elephant and roebuck roam,\nI too this day will take my bow\nAnd in the path before thee go.\nOur way will lie through forest ground\nWhere countless birds and beasts are found,\nI heed not homes of Gods on

love and care,\nShould Bharat, raised as king to sway\nThis noblest realm, his trust betray,\nNor for their safety well provide,\nSeduced by ill-suggesting pride,\nDoubt not my vengeful hand shall

prepare.\nI'll bring thee roots and berries sweet.\nAnd woodland fare which hermits eat.\nThou shall with thy Videhan spouse\nRecline upon the mountain's brows;\nBe mine the toil, be mine to keep\nWatch o'er thee waking or asleep.”\nFilled by his speech with joy and pride,\nRáma to Lakshmaṇ thus replied:\n“Go then, my brother, bid adieu\nTo all thy friends and retinue.\nAnd those two bows of fearful might,\nCelestial, which, at that famed rite,\nLord Varuṇ gave to Janak, king\nOf fair Vedeha with thee bring,\nWith heavenly coats of sword-proof mail,\nQuivers, whose arrows never fail,\nAnd golden-hilted swords so keen,\nThe rivals of the sun in sheen.\nTended with care these arms are all\nPreserved in my preceptor's hall.\nWith speed, O Lakshmaṇ, go, produce,\nAnd bring them hither for our use.”\nSo on a woodland life intent,\nTo see his faithful friends he went,\nAnd brought the heavenly arms which lay\nBy Ráma's teacher stored away.\nAnd Raghu's son to Ráma showed\nThose wondrous arms which gleamed and glowed,\nWell kept, adorned with many a wreath\nOf flowers on case, and hilt, and sheath.\nThe prudent Ráma at the sight\nAddressed his brother with delight:\n“Well art thou come, my brother dear,\nFor much I longed to see thee here.\nFor with thine aid, before I go,\nI would my gold and wealth bestow\nUpon the Bráhmans sage, who school\nTheir lives by stern devotion's rule.\nAnd for all those who ever dwell\nWithin my house and serve me well,\nDevoted servants, true and good,\nWill I provide a livelihood.\nQuick, go and summon to this place\nThe good Vaśishṭha's son,\nSuyajǹa, of the Bráhman race\nThe first and holiest one.\nTo all the Bráhmans wise and good\nWill I due reverence pay,\nThen to the solitary wood\nWith thee will take my way.”</code>"

Near he drew\nWith hands upraised in reverence due.\nWith blessing first his king he hailed;\nThen with a voice that well-nigh failed,\nIn trembling accents soft and low\nAddressed the monarch in his woe:\n“The prince of men, thy Ráma, waits\nBefore thee at the palace gates.\nHis wealth to Bráhmans he has dealt,\nAnd all who in his home have dwelt.\nAdmit thy son. His friends have heard\nHis kind farewell and parting word,\nHe longs to see thee first, and then\nWill seek the wilds, O King of men.\nHe, with each princely virtue's blaze,\nShines as the sun engirt by rays.”\nThe truthful King who loved to keep\nThe law profound as Ocean's deep,\nAnd stainless as the dark blue sky,\nThus to Sumantra made reply:\n“Go then, Sumantra, go and call\nMy wives and ladies one and all.\nDrawn round me shall they fill the place\nWhen I behold my Ráma's face.”\nQuick to the inner rooms he sped,\nAnd thus to all the women said,\n“Come, at the summons of the king:\nCome all, and make no tarrying.”\nTheir husband's word, by him conveyed,\nSoon as they heard, the dames obeyed,\nAnd following his guidance all\nCame thronging to the regal hall.\nIn number half seven hundred, they,\nAll lovely dames, in long array,\nWith their bright eyes for weeping red,\nTo stand round Queen Kauśalyá, sped.\nThey gathered, and the monarch viewed\nOne moment all the multitude,\nThen to Sumantra spoke and said:\n“Now let my son be hither led.”\nSumantra went. Then Ráma came,\nAnd Lakshmaṇ, and the Maithil dame,\nAnd, as he led them on, their guide\nStraight to the monarch's presence hied.\nWhen yet far off the father saw\nHis son with raised palms toward him draw,\nGirt by his ladies, sick with woes,\nSwift from his royal seat he rose.\nWith all his strength the aged man\nTo meet his darling Ráma ran,\nBut trembling, wild with dark despair,\nFell on the ground and fainted there.\nAnd Lakshmaṇ, wont in cars to ride,\nAnd Ráma, threw them by the side\nOf the poor miserable king,\nHalf lifeless with his sorrow's sting.\nThroughout the spacious hall up went\nA thousand women's wild lament:\n“Ah Ráma!” thus they wailed and wept,\nAnd anklets tinkled as they stepped\nAround his body, weeping, threw\nTheir loving arms the brothers two,\nAnd then, with Sítá's gentle aid,\nThe king upon a couch was laid.\nAt length to earth's imperial lord,\nWhen life and knowledge were restored,\nThough seas of woe went o'er his head,\nWith suppliant hand, thus Ráma said:\n“Lord of us all, great King, thou art:\nBid me farewell before we part,\nTo Daṇḍak wood this day I go:\nOne blessing and one look bestow.\nLet Lakshmaṇ my companion be,\nAnd Sítá also follow me.\nWith truthful pleas I sought to bend\nTheir purpose; but no ear they lend.\nNow cast this sorrow from thy heart,\nAnd let us all, great King, depart.\nAs Brahmá sends his children, so\nLet Lakshmaṇ, me, and Sítá go.”\nHe stood unmoved, and watched intent\nUntil the king should grant consent.\nUpon his son his eyes he cast,\nAnd thus the monarch spake at last:\n“O Ráma, by her arts enslaved,\nI gave the boons Kaikeyí craved,\nUnfit to reign, by her misled:\nBe ruler in thy father's stead.”\nThus by the lord of men addressed,\nRáma, of virtue's friends the best,\nIn lore of language duly learned,\nHis answer, reverent, thus returned:\n“A thousand years, O King, remain\nO'er this our city still to reign.\nI in the woods my life will lead:\nThe lust of rule no more I heed.\nNine years and five I there will spend,\nAnd when the portioned days shall end,\nWill come, my vows and exile o'er,\nAnd clasp thy feet, my King, once more.”\nA captive in the snare of truth,\nWeeping, distressed with woe and ruth,\nThus spake the monarch, while the queen\nKaikeyí urged him on unseen:\n“Go then, O Ráma, and begin\nThy course unvext by fear and sin:\nGo, my beloved son, and earn\nSuccess, and joy, and safe return.\nSo fast the bonds of duty bind.\nO Raghu's son, thy truthful mind,\nThat naught can turn thee back, or guide\nThy will so strongly fortified.\nBut O, a little longer stay,\nNor turn thy steps this night away,\nThat I one little day-—alas!\nOne only—-with my son may pass.\nMe and thy mother do not slight,\nBut stay, my son, with me to-night;\nWith every dainty please thy taste,\nAnd seek to-morrow morn the waste.\nHard is thy task, O Raghu's son,\nDire is the toil thou wilt not shun,\nFar to the lonely wood to flee,\nAnd leave thy friends for love of me.\nI swear it by my truth, believe,\nFor thee, my son, I deeply grieve,\nMisguided by the traitress dame\nWith hidden guile like smouldering flame.\nNow, by her wicked counsel stirred,\nThou fain wouldst keep my plighted word.\nNo marvel that my eldest born\nWould hold me true when I have sworn.”\nThen Ráma having calmly heard\nHis wretched father speak each word,\nWith Lakshmaṇ standing by his side\nThus, humbly, to the King replied:\n“If dainties now my taste regale,\nTo-morrow must those dainties fail.\nThis day departure I prefer\nTo all that wealth can minister.\nO'er this fair land, no longer mine,\nWhich I, with all her realms, resign,\nHer multitudes of men, her grain,\nHer stores of wealth, let Bharat reign.\nAnd let the promised boon which thou\nWast pleased to grant the queen ere now,\nBe hers in full. Be true, O King,\nKind giver of each precious thing.\nThy spoken word I still will heed,\nObeying all thy lips decreed:\nAnd fourteen years in woods will dwell\nWith those who live in glade and dell.\nNo hopes of power my heart can touch,\nNo selfish joys attract so much\nAs son of Raghu, to fulfil\nWith heart and soul my father's will.\nDismiss, dismiss thy needless woe,\nNor let those drowning torrents flow:\nThe Lord of Rivers in his pride\nKeeps to the banks that bar his tide.\nHere in thy presence I declare;\nBy thy good deeds, thy truth, I swear;\nNor lordship, joy, nor lands I prize;\nLife, heaven, all blessings I despise.\nI wish to see thee still remain\nMost true, O King, and free from stain.\nIt must not, Sire, it must not be:\nI cannot rest one hour with thee.\nThen bring this sorrow to an end,\nFor naught my settled will can bend.\nI gave a pledge that binds me too,\nAnd to that pledge I still am true.\nKaikeyí bade me speed away:\nShe prayed me, and I answered yea.\nPine not for me, and weep no more;\nThe wood for us has joy in store,\nFilled with the wild deer's peaceful herds\nAnd voices of a thousand birds.\nA father is the God of each,\nYea, e'en of Gods, so Scriptures teach:\nAnd I will keep my sire's decree,\nFor as a God I honour thee.\nO best of men, the time is nigh,\nThe fourteen years will soon pass by\nAnd to thine eyes thy son restore:\nBe comforted, and weep no more.\nThou with thy firmness shouldst support\nThese weeping crowds who throng the court;\nThen why, O chief of high renown,\nSo troubled, and thy soul cast down?”</code>"

With tears his eyes grew dim,\nHis senses all deserted him.\nHe cried, O Ráma, once, then weak\nAnd fainting could no further speak.\nUnconscious there he lay: at length\nRegathering his sense and strength,\nWhile his full eyes their torrents shed,\nTo wise Sumantra thus he said:\n“Yoke the light car, and hither lead\nFleet coursers of the noblest breed,\nAnd drive this heir of lofty fate\nBeyond the limit of the state.\nThis seems the fruit that virtues bear,\nThe meed of worth which texts declare—\nThe sending of the brave and good\nBy sire and mother to the wood.'”\nHe heard the monarch, and obeyed,\nWith ready feet that ne'er delayed,\nAnd brought before the palace gate\nThe horses and the car of state.\nThen to the monarch's son he sped,\nAnd raising hands of reverence said\nThat the light car which gold made fair,\nWith best of steeds, was standing there.\nKing Daśaratha called in haste\nThe lord o'er all his treasures placed.\nAnd spoke, well skilled in place and time,\nHis will to him devoid of crime:\n“Count all the years she has to live\nAfar in forest wilds, and give\nTo Sítá robes and gems of price\nAs for the time may well suffice.”\nQuick to the treasure-room he went,\nCharged by that king most excellent,\nBrought the rich stores, and gave them all\nTo Sítá in the monarch's hall.\nThe Maithil dame of high descent\nReceived each robe and ornament,\nAnd tricked those limbs, whose lines foretold\nHigh destiny, with gems and gold.\nSo well adorned, so fair to view,\nA glory through the hall she threw:\nSo, when the Lord of Light upsprings,\nHis radiance o'er the sky he flings.\nThen Queen Kauśalyá spake at last,\nWith loving arms about her cast,\nPressed lingering kisses on her head,\nAnd to the high-souled lady said:\n“Ah, in this faithless world below\nWhen dark misfortune comes and woe,\nWives, loved and cherished every day,\nNeglect their lords and disobey.\nYes, woman's nature still is this:—\nAfter long days of calm and bliss\nWhen some light grief her spirit tries,\nShe changes all her love, or flies.\nYoung wives are thankless, false in soul,\nWith roving hearts that spurn control.\nBrooding on sin and quickly changed,\nIn one short hour their love estranged.\nNot glorious deed or lineage fair,\nNot knowledge, gift, or tender care\nIn chains of lasting love can bind\nA woman's light inconstant mind.\nBut those good dames who still maintain\nWhat right, truth, Scripture, rule ordain—\nNo holy thing in their pure eyes\nWith one beloved husband vies.\nNor let thy lord my son, condemned\nTo exile, be by thee contemned,\nFor be he poor or wealthy, he\nIs as a God, dear child, to thee.”\nWhen Sítá heard Kauśalyá's speech\nHer duty and her gain to teach,\nShe joined her palms with reverent grace\nAnd gave her answer face to face:\n“All will I do, forgetting naught,\nWhich thou, O honoured Queen, hast taught.\nI know, have heard, and deep have stored\nThe rules of duty to my lord.\nNot me, good Queen, shouldst thou include\nAmong the faithless multitude.\nIts own sweet light the moon shall leave\nEre I to duty cease to cleave.\nThe stringless lute gives forth no strain,\nThe wheelless car is urged in vain;\nNo joy a lordless dame, although\nBlest with a hundred sons, can know.\nFrom father, brother, and from son\nA measured share of joy is won:\nWho would not honour, love, and bless\nHer lord, whose gifts are measureless?\nThus trained to think, I hold in awe\nScripture's command and duty's law.\nHim can I hold in slight esteem?\nHer lord is woman's God, I deem.”\nKauśalyá heard the lady's speech,\nNor failed those words her heart to reach.\nThen, pure in mind, she gave to flow\nThe tear that sprang of joy and woe.\nThen duteous Ráma forward came\nAnd stood before the honoured dame,\nAnd joining reverent hands addressed\nThe queen in rank above the rest:\n“O mother, from these tears refrain;\nLook on my sire and still thy pain.\nTo thee my days afar shall fly\nAs if sweet slumber closed thine eye,\nAnd fourteen years of exile seem\nTo thee, dear mother, like a dream.\nOn me returning safe and well,\nGirt by my friends, thine eyes shall dwell.”\nThus for their deep affection's sake\nThe hero to his mother spake,\nThen to the half seven hundred too,\nWives of his sire, paid reverence due.\nThus Daśaratha's son addressed\nThat crowd of matrons sore distressed:\n“If from these lips, while here I dwelt,\nOne heedless taunt you e'er have felt,\nForgive me, pray. And now adieu,\nI bid good-bye to all of you.”\nThen straight, like curlews' cries, upwent\nThe voices of their wild lament,\nWhile, as he bade farewell, the crowd\nOf royal women wept aloud,\nAnd through the ample hall's extent.\nWhere erst the sound of tabour, blent\nWith drum and shrill-toned instrument,\nIn joyous concert rose,\nNow rang the sound of wailing high,\nThe lamentation and the cry,\nThe shriek, the choking sob, the sigh\nThat told the ladies' woes.</code>"

Fare thee well.”\nHer blessing thus Sumitrá gave\nTo him whose soul to Ráma clave,\nExclaiming, when her speech was done,\n“Go forth, O Lakshmaṇ, go, my son.\nGo forth, my son to win success,\nHigh victory and happiness.\nGo forth thy foemen to destroy,\nAnd turn again at last with joy.”\nAs Mátali his charioteer\nSpeaks for the Lord of Gods to hear,\nSumantra, palm to palm applied,\nIn reverence trained, to Ráma cried:\n“O famous Prince, my car ascend,—\nMay blessings on thy course attend,—\nAnd swiftly shall my horses flee\nAnd place thee where thou biddest me.\nThe fourteen years thou hast to stay\nFar in the wilds, begin to-day;\nFor Oueen Kaikeyí cries, Away.”\nThen Sítá, best of womankind,\nAscended, with a tranquil mind,\nSoon as her toilet task was done,\nThat chariot brilliant as the sun.\nRáma and Lakshmaṇ true and bold\nSprang on the car adorned with gold.\nThe king those years had counted o'er,\nAnd given Sítá robes and store\nOf precious ornaments to wear\nWhen following her husband there.\nThe brothers in the car found place\nFor nets and weapons of the chase,\nThere warlike arms and mail they laid,\nA leathern basket and a spade.\nSoon as Sumantra saw the three\nWere seated in the chariot, he\nUrged on each horse of noble breed,\nWho matched the rushing wind in speed.\nAs thus the son of Raghu went\nForth for his dreary banishment,\nChill numbing grief the town assailed,\nAll strength grew weak, all spirit failed,\nAyodhyá through her wide extent\nWas filled with tumult and lament:\nSteeds neighed and shook the bells they bore,\nEach elephant returned a roar.\nThen all the city, young and old,\nWild with their sorrow uncontrolled,\nRushed to the car, as, from the sun\nThe panting herds to water run.\nBefore the car, behind, they clung,\nAnd there as eagerly they hung,\nWith torrents streaming from their eyes,\nCalled loudly with repeated cries:\n“Listen, Sumantra: draw thy rein;\nDrive gently, and thy steeds restrain.\nOnce more on Ráma will we gaze,\nNow to be lost for many days.\nThe queen his mother has, be sure,\nA heart of iron, to endure\nTo see her godlike Ráma go,\nNor feel it shattered by the blow.\nSítá, well done! Videha's pride,\nStill like his shadow by his side;\nRejoicing in thy duty still\nAs sunlight cleaves to Meru's hill.\nThou, Lakshmaṇ, too, hast well deserved,\nWho from thy duty hast not swerved,\nTending the peer of Gods above,\nWhose lips speak naught but words of love.\nThy firm resolve is nobly great,\nAnd high success on thee shall wait.\nYea, thou shalt win a priceless meed—\nThy path with him to heaven shall lead.”\nAs thus they spake, they could not hold\nThe tears that down their faces rolled,\nWhile still they followed for a space\nTheir darling of Ikshváku's race.\nThere stood surrounded by a ring\nOf mournful wives the mournful king;\nFor, “I will see once more,” he cried,\n“Mine own dear son,” and forth he hied.\nAs he came near, there rose the sound\nOf weeping, as the dames stood round.\nSo the she-elephants complain\nWhen their great lord and guide is slain.\nKakutstha's son, the king of men,\nThe glorious sire, looked troubled then,\nAs the full moon is when dismayed\nBy dark eclipse's threatening shade.\nThen Daśaratha's son, designed\nFor highest fate of lofty mind,\nUrged to more speed the charioteer,\n“Away, away! why linger here?\nUrge on thy horses,” Rama cried,\nAnd “Stay, O stay,” the people sighed.\nSumantra, urged to speed away,\nThe townsmen's call must disobey,\nForth as the long-armed hero went,\nThe dust his chariot wheels up sent\nWas laid by streams that ever flowed\nFrom their sad eyes who filled the road.\nThen, sprung of woe, from eyes of all\nThe women drops began to fall,\nAs from each lotus on the lake\nThe darting fish the water shake.\nWhen he, the king of high renown,\nSaw that one thought held all the town,\nLike some tall tree he fell and lay,\nWhose root the axe has hewn away.\nThen straight a mighty cry from those\nWho followed Ráma's car arose,\nWho saw their monarch fainting there\nBeneath that grief too great to bear.\nThen “Ráma, Ráma!” with the cry\nOf “Ah, his mother!” sounded high,\nAs all the people wept aloud\nAround the ladies' sorrowing crowd.\nWhen Ráma backward turned his eye,\nAnd saw the king his father lie\nWith troubled sense and failing limb,\nAnd the sad queen, who followed him,\nLike some young creature in the net,\nThat will not, in its misery, let\nIts wild eyes on its mother rest,\nSo, by the bonds of duty pressed,\nHis mother's look he could not meet.\nHe saw them with their weary feet,\nWho, used to bliss, in cars should ride,\nWho ne'er by sorrow should be tried,\nAnd, as one mournful look he cast,\n“Drive on,” he cried, “Sumantra, fast.”\nAs when the driver's torturing hook\nGoads on an elephant, the look\nOf sire and mother in despair\nWas more than Ráma's heart could bear.\nAs mother kine to stalls return\nWhich hold the calves for whom they yearn,\nSo to the car she tried to run\nAs a cow seeks her little one.\nOnce and again the hero's eyes\nLooked on his mother, as with cries\nOf woe she called and gestures wild,\n“O Sítá, Lakshmaṇ, O my child!”\n“Stay,” cried the king, “thy chariot stay:”\n“On, on,” cried Ráma, “speed away.”\nAs one between two hosts, inclined\nTo neither was Sumantra's mind.\nBut Ráma spake these words again:\n“A lengthened woe is bitterest pain.\nOn, on; and if his wrath grow hot,\nThine answer be, ‘I heard thee not.’ ”\nSumantra, at the chief's behest,\nDismissed the crowd that toward him pressed,\nAnd, as he bade, to swiftest speed\nUrged on his way each willing steed.\nThe king's attendants parted thence,\nAnd paid him heart-felt reverence:\nIn mind, and with the tears he wept,\nEach still his place near Ráma kept.\nAs swift away the horses sped,\nHis lords to Daśaratha said:\n“To follow him whom thou again\nWouldst see returning home is vain.”\nWith failing limb and drooping mien\nHe heard their counsel wise:\nStill on their son the king and queen\nKept fast their lingering eyes.</code>"

has highest praise,\nWhere deer, and bird, and glittering snake,\nGod, Daitya, bard their pastime take.”\nSumantra, Lakshmaṇ gave assent,\nAnd with the steeds they thither went.\nWhen Ráma reached the lovely tree,\nWith Sítá and with Lakshmaṇ, he\nAlighted from the car: with speed\nSumantra loosed each weary steed.\nAnd, hand to hand in reverence laid,\nStood near to Ráma in the shade.\nRáma's dear friend, renowned by fame,\nWho of Nisháda lineage came,\nGuha, the mighty chief, adored\nThrough all the land as sovereign lord,\nSoon as he heard that prince renowned\nWas resting on Nisháda ground,\nBegirt by counsellor and peer\nAnd many an honoured friend drew near.\nSoon as the monarch came in view,\nRáma and Lakshmaṇ toward him flew.\nThen Guha, at the sight distressed,\nHis arms around the hero pressed,\nLaid both his hands upon his head\nBowed to those lotus feet, and said:\n“O Ráma, make thy wishes known,\nAnd be this kingdom as thine own.\nWho, mighty-armed, will ever see\nA guest so dear as thou to me?”\nHe placed before him dainty fare\nOf every flavour, rich and rare,\nBrought forth the gift for honoured guest,\nAnd thus again the chief addressed:\n“Welcome, dear Prince, whose arms are strong;\nThese lands and all to thee belong.\nThy servants we, our lord art thou;\nBegin, good king, thine empire now.\nSee, various food before thee placed,\nAnd cups to drink and sweets to taste\nFor thee soft beds are hither borne,\nAnd for thy horses grass and corn.”\nTo Guha as he pressed and prayed,\nThus Raghu's son his answer made:\n“'Twas aye thy care my heart to please\nWith honour, love, and courtesies,\nAnd friendship brings thee now to greet\nThy guest thus humbly on thy feet.”\nAgain the hero spake, as round\nThe king his shapely arms he wound:\n“Guha, I see that all is well\nWith thee and those who with thee dwell;\nThat health and bliss and wealth attend\nThy realm, thyself, and every friend.\nBut all these friendly gifts of thine,\nBound to refuse, I must decline.\nGrass, bark, and hide my only wear,\nAnd woodland roots and fruit my fare,\nOn duty all my heart is set;\nI seek the woods, an anchoret.\nA little grass and corn to feed\nThe horses—this is all I need.\nSo by this favour, King, alone\nShall honour due to me be shown.\nFor these good steeds who brought me here\nAre to my sire supremely dear;\nAnd kind attention paid to these\nWill honour me and highly please.”\nThen Guha quickly bade his train\nGive water to the steeds, and grain.\nAnd Ráma, ere the night grew dark,\nPaid evening rites in dress of bark,\nAnd tasted water, on the strand,\nDrawn from the stream by Lakshmaṇ's hand.\nAnd Lakshmaṇ with observance meet\nBathed his beloved brother's feet,\nWho rested with his Maithil spouse:\nThen sat him down 'neath distant boughs.\nAnd Guha with his bow sat near\nTo Lakshmaṇ and the charioteer,\nAnd with the prince conversing kept\nHis faithful watch while Ráma slept.\nAs Daśaratha's glorious heir,\nOf lofty soul and wisdom rare,\nReclining with his Sítá there\nBeside the river lay—\nHe who no troubles e'er had seen,\nWhose life a life of bliss had been—\nThat night beneath the branches green\nPassed pleasantly away.</code>"

Light,\nAnd fled is venerable night.\nThat dark-winged bird the Koïl now\nIs calling from the topmost bough,\nAnd sounding from the thicket nigh\nIs heard the peacock's early cry.\nCome, cross the flood that seeks the sea,\nThe swiftly flowing Jáhnaví.” \nKing Guha heard his speech, agreed,\nAnd called his minister with speed:\n“A boat,” he cried, “swift, strong, and fair,\nWith rudder, oars, and men, prepare,\nAnd place it ready by the shore\nTo bear the pilgrims quickly o'er.”\nThus Guha spake: his followers all\nBestirred them at their master's call;\nThen told the king that ready manned\nA gay boat waited near the strand.\nThen Guha, hand to hand applied,\nWith reverence thus to Ráma cried:\n“The boat is ready by the shore:\nHow, tell me, can I aid thee more?\nO lord of men, it waits for thee\nTo cross the flood that seeks the sea.\nO godlike keeper of thy vow,\nEmbark: the boat is ready now.”\nThen Ráma, lord of glory high,\nThus to King Guha made reply:\n“Thanks for thy gracious care, my lord:\nNow let the gear be placed on board.”\nEach bow-armed chief, in mail encased,\nBound sword and quiver to his waist,\nAnd then with Sítá near them hied\nDown the broad river's shelving side.\nThen with raised palms the charioteer,\nIn lowly reverence drawing near,\nCried thus to Ráma good and true:\n“Now what remains for me to do?”\nWith his right hand, while answering\nThe hero touched his friend:\n“Go back,” he said, “and on the king\nWith watchful care attend.\nThus far, Sumantra, thou wast guide;\nNow to Ayodhyá turn,” he cried:\n“Hence seek we leaving steeds and car,\nOn foot the wood that stretches far.”\nSumantra, when, with grieving heart,\nHe heard the hero bid him part,\nThus to the bravest of the brave,\nIkshváku's son, his answer gave:\n“In all the world men tell of naught,\nTo match thy deed, by heroes wrought—\nThus with thy brother and thy wife\nThrall-like to lead a forest life.\nNo meet reward of fruit repays\nThy holy lore, thy saintlike days,\nThy tender soul, thy love of truth,\nIf woe like this afflicts thy youth.\nThou, roaming under forest boughs\nWith thy dear brother and thy spouse\nShalt richer meed of glory gain\nThan if three worlds confessed thy reign.\nSad is our fate, O Ráma: we,\nAbandoned and repelled by thee,\nMust serve as thralls Kaikeyí's will,\nImperious, wicked, born to ill.”\nThus cried the faithful charioteer,\nAs Raghu's son, in rede his peer,\nWas fast departing on his road,—\nAnd long his tears of anguish flowed.\nBut Ráma, when those tears were dried\nHis lips with water purified,\nAnd in soft accents, sweet and clear,\nAgain addressed the charioteer:\n“I find no heart, my friend, like thine,\nSo faithful to Ikshváku's line.\nStill first in view this object keep,\nThat ne'er for me my sire may weep.\nFor he, the world's far-ruling king,\nIs old, and wild with sorrow's sting;\nWith love's great burthen worn and weak:\nDeem this the cause that thus I speak\nWhate'er the high-souled king decrees\nHis loved Kaikeyí's heart to please,\nYea, be his order what it may,\nWithout demur thou must obey,\nFor this alone great monarchs reign,\nThat ne'er a wish be formed in vain.\nThen, O Sumantra, well provide\nThat by no check the king be tried:\nNor let his heart in sorrow pine:\nThis care, my faithful friend, be thine.\nThe honoured king my father greet,\nAnd thus for me my words repeat\nTo him whose senses are controlled,\nUntired till now by grief, and old;\n“I, Sítá, Lakshmaṇ sorrow not,\nO Monarch, for our altered lot:\nThe same to us, if here we roam,\nOr if Ayodhyá be our home,\nThe fourteen years will quickly fly,\nThe happy hour will soon be nigh\nWhen thou, my lord, again shalt see\nLakshmaṇ, the Maithil dame, and me.”\nThus having soothed, O charioteer,\nMy father and my mother dear,\nLet all the queens my message learn,\nBut to Kaikeyí chiefly turn.\nWith loving blessings from the three,\nFrom Lakshmaṇ, Sítá, and from me,\nMy mother, Queen Kauśalyá, greet\nWith reverence to her sacred feet.\nAnd add this prayer of mine: “O King;\nSend quickly forth and Bharat bring,\nAnd set him on the royal throne\nWhich thy decree has made his own.\nWhen he upon the throne is placed,\nWhen thy fond arms are round him laced,\nThine aged heart will cease to ache\nWith bitter pangs for Ráma's sake.”\nAnd say to Bharat: “See thou treat\nThe queens with all observance meet:\nWhat care the king receives, the same\nShow thou alike to every dame.\nObedience to thy father's will\nWho chooses thee the throne to fill,\nWill earn for thee a store of bliss\nBoth in the world to come and this.’ ”\nThus Ráma bade Sumantra go\nWith thoughtful care instructed so.\nSumantra all his message heard,\nAnd spake again, by passion stirred:\n“O, should deep feeling mar in aught\nThe speech by fond devotion taught,\nForgive whate'er I wildly speak:\nMy love is strong, my tongue is weak.\nHow shall I, if deprived of thee,\nReturn that mournful town to see:\nWhere sick at heart the people are\nBecause their Ráma roams afar.\nWoe will be theirs too deep to brook\nWhen on the empty car they look,\nAs when from hosts, whose chiefs are slain,\nOne charioteer comes home again.\nThis very day, I ween, is food\nForsworn by all the multitude,\nThinking that thou, with hosts to aid,\nArt dwelling in the wild wood's shade.\nThe great despair, the shriek of woe\nThey uttered when they saw thee go,\nWill, when I come with none beside,\nA hundred-fold be multiplied.\nHow to Kauśalyá can I say:\n“O Queen, I took thy son away,\nAnd with thy brother left him well:\nWeep not for him; thy woe dispel?”\nSo false a tale I cannot frame,\nYet how speak truth and grieve the dame?\nHow shall these horses, fleet and bold,\nWhom not a hand but mine can hold,\nBear others, wont to whirl the car\nWherein Ikshváku's children are!\nWithout thee, Prince, I cannot, no,\nI cannot to Ayodhyá go.\nThen deign, O Ráma, to relent,\nAnd let me share thy banishment.\nBut if no prayers can move thy heart,\nIf thou wilt quit me and depart,\nThe flames shall end my car and me,\nDeserted thus and reft of thee.\nIn the wild wood when foes are near,\nWhen dangers check thy vows austere,\nBorne in my car will I attend,\nAll danger and all care to end.\nFor thy dear sake I love the skill\nThat guides the steed and curbs his will:\nAnd soon a forest life will be\nAs pleasant, for my love of thee.\nAnd if these horses near thee dwell,\nAnd serve thee in the forest well,\nThey, for their service, will not miss\nThe due reward of highest bliss.\nThine orders, as with thee I stray,\nWill I with heart and head obey,\nPrepared, for thee, without a sigh,\nTo lose Ayodhyá or the sky.\nAs one defiled with hideous sin,\nI never more can pass within\nAyodhyá, city of our king,\nUnless beside me thee I bring.\nOne wish is mine, I ask no more,\nThat, when thy banishment is o'er\nI in my car may bear my lord,\nTriumphant, to his home restored.\nThe fourteen years, if spent with thee,\nWill swift as light-winged moments flee;\nBut the same years, without thee told,\nWere magnified a hundred-fold.\nDo not, kind lord, thy servant leave,\nWho to his master's son would cleave,\nAnd the same path with him pursue,\nDevoted, tender, just and true.”\nAgain, again Sumantra made\nHis varied plaint, and wept and prayed.\nHim Raghu's son, whose tender breast\nFelt for his servants, thus addressed:\n“O faithful servant, well my heart\nKnows how attached and true thou art.\nHear thou the words I speak, and know\nWhy to the town I bid thee go.\nSoon as Kaikeyí, youngest queen,\nThy coming to the town has seen,\nNo doubt will then her mind oppress\nThat Ráma roams the wilderness.\nAnd so the dame, her heart content\nWith proof of Ráma's banishment,\nWill doubt the virtuous king no more\nAs faithless to the oath he swore.\nChief of my cares is this, that she,\nYoungest amid the queens, may see\nBharat her son securely reign\nO'er rich Ayodhyá's wide domain.\nFor mine and for the monarch's sake\nDo thou thy journey homeward take,\nAnd, as I bade, repeat each word\nThat from my lips thou here hast heard.”\nThus spake the prince, and strove to cheer\nThe sad heart of the charioteer,\nAnd then to royal Guha said\nThese words most wise and spirited:\n“Guha, dear friend, it is not meet\nThat people throng my calm retreat:\nFor I must live a strict recluse,\nAnd mould my life by hermits' use.\nI now the ancient rule accept\nBy good ascetics gladly kept.\nI go: bring fig-tree juice that I\nIn matted coils my hair may tie.”\nQuick Guha hastened to produce,\nFor the king's son, that sacred juice.\nThen Ráma of his long locks made,\nAnd Lakshmaṇ's too, the hermit braid.\nAnd the two royal brothers there\nWith coats of bark and matted hair,\nTransformed in lovely likeness stood\nTo hermit saints who love the wood.\nSo Ráma, with his brother bold,\nA pious anchorite enrolled,\nObeyed the vow which hermits take,\nAnd to his friend, King Guha, spake:\n“May people, treasure, army share,\nAnd fenced forts, thy constant care:\nAttend to all: supremely hard\nThe sovereign's task, to watch and guard.”\nIkshváku's son, the good and brave,\nThis last farewell to Guha gave,\nAnd then, with Lakshmaṇ and his bride,\nDetermined, on his way he hied.\nSoon as he viewed, upon the shore,\nThe bark prepared to waft them o'er\nImpetuous Gangá's rolling tide,\nTo Lakshmaṇ thus the chieftain cried:\n“Brother, embark; thy hand extend,\nThy gentle aid to Sítá lend:\nWith care her trembling footsteps guide,\nAnd place the lady by thy side.”\nWhen Lakshmaṇ heard, prepared to aid,\nHis brother's words he swift obeyed.\nWithin the bark he placed the dame,\nThen to her side the hero came.\nNext Lakshmaṇ's elder brother, lord\nOf brightest glory, when on board,\nBreathing a prayer for blessings, meet\nFor priest or warrior to repeat,\nThen he and car-borne Lakshmaṇ bent,\nWell-pleased, their heads, most reverent,\nTheir hands, with Sítá, having dipped,\nAs Scripture bids, and water sipped,\nFarewell to wise Sumantra said,\nAnd Guha, with the train he led.\nSo Ráma took, on board, his stand,\nAnd urged the vessel from the land.\nThen swift by vigorous arms impelled\nHer onward course the vessel held,\nAnd guided by the helmsman through\nThe dashing waves of Gangá flew.\nHalf way across the flood they came,\nWhen Sítá, free from spot and blame,\nHer reverent hands together pressed,\nThe Goddess of the stream addressed:\n“May the great chieftain here who springs\nFrom Daśaratha, best of kings,\nProtected by thy care, fulfil\nHis prudent father's royal will.\nWhen in the forest he has spent\nHis fourteen years of banishment,\nWith his dear brother and with me\nHis home again my lord shall see.\nReturning on that blissful day,\nI will to thee mine offerings pay,\nDear Queen, whose waters gently flow,\nWho canst all blessed gifts bestow.\nFor, three-pathed Queen, though wandering here,\nThy waves descend from Brahmá's sphere,\nSpouse of the God o'er floods supreme,\nThough rolling here thy glorious stream.\nTo thee, fair Queen, my head shall bend,\nTo thee shall hymns of praise ascend,\nWhen my brave lord shall turn again,\nAnd, joyful, o'er his kingdom reign.\nTo win thy grace, O Queen divine,\nA hundred thousand fairest kine,\nAnd precious robes and finest meal\nAmong the Bráhmans will I deal.\nA hundred jars of wine shall flow,\nWhen to my home, O Queen, I go;\nWith these, and flesh, and corn, and rice,\nWill I, delighted, sacrifice.\nEach hallowed spot, each holy shrine\nThat stands on these fair shores of thine,\nEach fane and altar on thy banks\nShall share my offerings and thanks.\nWith me and Lakshmaṇ, free from harm,\nMay he the blameless, strong of arm,\nReseek Ayodhyá from the wild,\nO blameless Lady undefiled!”\nAs, praying for her husband's sake,\nThe faultless dame to Gangá spake,\nTo the right bank the vessel flew\nWith her whose heart was right and true.\nSoon as the bark had crossed the wave,\nThe lion leader of the brave,\nLeaving the vessel on the strand,\nWith wife and brother leapt to land.\nThen Ráma thus the prince addressed\nWho filled with joy Sumitrá's breast:\n“Be thine alike to guard and aid\nIn peopled spot, in lonely shade.\nDo thou, Sumitrá's son, precede:\nLet Sítá walk where thou shalt lead.\nBehind you both my place shall be,\nTo guard the Maithil dame and thee.\nFor she, to woe a stranger yet,\nNo toil or grief till now has met;\nThe fair Videhan will assay\nThe pains of forest life to-day.\nTo-day her tender feet must tread\nRough rocky wilds around her spread:\nNo tilth is there, no gardens grow,\nNo crowding people come and go.”\nThe hero ceased: and Lakshmaṇ led\nObedient to the words he said:\nAnd Sítá followed him, and then\nCame Raghu's pride, the lord of men.\nWith Sítá walking o'er the sand\nThey sought the forest, bow in hand,\nBut still their lingering glances threw\nWhere yet Sumantra stood in view.\nSumantra, when his watchful eye\nThe royal youths no more could spy,\nTurned from the spot whereon he stood\nHomeward with Guha from the wood.\nStill on the brothers forced their way\nWhere sweet birds sang on every spray,\nThough scarce the eye a path could find\nMid flowering trees where creepers twined.\nFar on the princely brothers pressed,\nAnd stayed their feet at length to rest\nBeneath a fig tree's mighty shade\nWith countless pendent shoots displayed.\nReclining there a while at ease,\nThey saw, not far, beneath fair trees\nA lake with many a lotus bright\nThat bore the name of Lovely Sight.\nRáma his wife's attention drew,\nAnd Lakshmaṇ's, to the charming view:\n“Look, brother, look how fair the flood\nGlows with the lotus, flower and bud!”\nThey drank the water fresh and clear,\nAnd with their shafts they slew a deer.\nA fire of boughs they made in haste,\nAnd in the flame the meat they placed.\nSo Raghu's sons with Sítá shared\nThe hunter's meal their hands prepared,\nThen counselled that the spreading tree\nTheir shelter and their home should be.</code>"

I fear, lest borne away\nBy frenzy of success, she slay\nKauśalyá, through her wicked hate\nOf me, bereft, disconsolate;\nOr her who aye for me has striven\nSumitrá, to devotion given.\nHence, Lakshmaṇ, to Ayodhyá speed,\nReturning in the hour of need.\nWith Sítá I my steps will bend\nWhere Daṇḍak's mighty woods extend.\nNo guardian has Kauśalyá now:\nO, be her friend and guardian thou.\nStrong hate may vile Kaikeyí lead\nTo many a base unrighteous deed,\nTreading my mother 'neath her feet\nWhen Bharat holds the royal seat.\nSure in some antenatal time\nWere children, by Kauśalyá's crime,\nTorn from their mothers' arms away,\nAnd hence she mourns this evil day.\nShe for her child no toil would spare\nTending me long with pain and care;\nNow in the hour of fruitage she\nHas lost that son, ah, woe is me.\nO Lakshmaṇ, may no matron e'er\nA son so doomed to sorrow bear\nAs I, my mother's heart who rend\nWith anguish that can never end.\nThe Sáriká,  methinks, possessed\nMore love than glows in Ráma's breast.\nWho, as the tale is told to us,\nAddressed the stricken parrot thus:\n“Parrot, the capturer's talons tear,\nWhile yet alone thou flutterest there,\nBefore his mouth has closed on me:”\nSo cried the bird, herself to free.\nReft of her son, in childless woe,\nMy mother's tears for ever flow:\nIll-fated, doomed with grief to strive,\nWhat aid can she from me derive?\nPressed down by care, she cannot rise\nFrom sorrow's flood wherein she lies.\nIn righteous wrath my single arm\nCould, with my bow, protect from harm\nAyodhyá's town and all the earth:\nBut what is hero prowess worth?\nLest breaking duty's law I sin,\nAnd lose the heaven I strive to win,\nThe forest life today I choose,\nAnd kingly state and power refuse.”\nThus mourning in that lonely spot\nThe troubled chief bewailed his lot,\nAnd filled with tears, his eyes ran o'er;\nThen silent sat, and spake no more.\nTo him, when ceased his loud lament,\nLike fire whose brilliant might is spent,\nOr the great sea when sleeps the wave,\nThus Lakshmaṇ consolation gave:\n“Chief of the brave who bear the bow,\nE'en now Ayodhyá, sunk in woe,\nBy thy departure reft of light\nIs gloomy as the moonless night.\nUnfit it seems that thou, O chief,\nShouldst so afflict thy soul with grief,\nSo with thou Sítá's heart consign\nTo deep despair as well as mine.\nNot I, O Raghu's son, nor she\nCould live one hour deprived of thee:\nWe were, without thine arm to save,\nLike fish deserted by the wave.\nAlthough my mother dear to meet,\nŚatrughna, and the king, were sweet,\nOn them, or heaven, to feed mine eye\nWere nothing, if thou wert not by.”\nSitting at ease, their glances fell\nUpon the beds, constructed well,\nAnd there the sons of virtue laid\nTheir limbs beneath the fig tree's shade.</code>"

made their way,\nThrough the dense wood that round them lay,\nWhere Yamuná's  swift waters glide\nTo blend with Gangá's holy tide.\nCharmed with the prospect ever new\nThe glorious heroes wandered through\nFull many a spot of pleasant ground,\nRejoicing as they gazed around,\nWith eager eye and heart at ease,\nOn countless sorts of flowery trees.\nAnd now the day was half-way sped\nWhen thus to Lakshmaṇ Ráma said:\n“There, there, dear brother, turn thine eyes;\nSee near Prayág  that smoke arise:\nThe banner of our Lord of Flames\nThe dwelling of some saint proclaims.\nNear to the place our steps we bend\nWhere Yamuná and Gangá blend.\nI hear and mark the deafening roar\nWhen chafing floods together pour.\nSee, near us on the ground are left\nDry logs, by labouring woodmen cleft,\nAnd the tall trees, that blossom near\nSaint Bharadvája's home, appear.”\nThe bow-armed princes onward passed,\nAnd as the sun was sinking fast\nThey reached the hermit's dwelling, set\nNear where the rushing waters met.\nThe presence of the warrior scared\nThe deer and birds as on he fared,\nAnd struck them with unwonted awe:\nThen Bharadvája's cot they saw.\nThe high-souled hermit soon they found\nGirt by his dear disciples round:\nCalm saint, whose vows had well been wrought,\nWhose fervent rites keen sight had bought.\nDuly had flames of worship blazed\nWhen Ráma on the hermit gazed:\nHis suppliant hands the hero raised,\nDrew nearer to the holy man\nWith his companions, and began,\nDeclaring both his name and race\nAnd why they sought that distant place:\n“Saint, Daśaratha's children we,\nRáma and Lakshmaṇ, come to thee.\nThis my good wife from Janak springs,\nThe best of fair Videha's kings;\nThrough lonely wilds, a faultless dame,\nTo this pure grove with me she came.\nMy younger brother follows still\nMe banished by my father's will:\nSumitrá's son, bound by a vow,—\nHe roams the wood beside me now.\nSent by my father forth to rove,\nWe seek, O Saint, some holy grove,\nWhere lives of hermits we may lead,\nAnd upon fruits and berries feed.”\nWhen Bharadvája, prudent-souled,\nHad heard the prince his tale unfold,\nWater he bade them bring, a bull,\nAnd honour-gifts in dishes full,\nAnd drink and food of varied taste,\nBerries and roots, before him placed,\nAnd then the great ascetic showed\nA cottage for the guests' abode.\nThe saint these honours gladly paid\nTo Ráma who had thither strayed,\nThen compassed sat by birds and deer\nAnd many a hermit resting near.\nThe prince received the service kind,\nAnd sat him down rejoiced in mind.\nThen Bharadvája silence broke,\nAnd thus the words of duty spoke:\n“Kakutstha's royal son, that thou\nHadst sought this grove I knew ere now.\nMine ears have heard thy story, sent\nWithout a sin to banishment.\nBehold, O Prince, this ample space\nNear where the mingling floods embrace,\nHoly, and beautiful, and clear:\nDwell with us, and be happy here.”\nBy Bharadvája thus addressed,\nRáma whose kind and tender breast\nAll living things would bless and save,\nIn gracious words his answer gave:\n“My honoured lord, this tranquil spot,\nFair home of hermits, suits me not:\nFor all the neighbouring people here\nWill seek us when they know me near:\nWith eager wish to look on me,\nAnd the Videhan dame to see,\nA crowd of rustics will intrude\nUpon the holy solitude.\nProvide, O gracious lord, I pray,\nSome quiet home that lies away,\nWhere my Videhan spouse may dwell\nTasting the bliss deserved so well.”\nThe hermit heard the prayer he made:\nA while in earnest thought he stayed,\nAnd then in words like these expressed\nHis answer to the chief's request:\n“Ten leagues away there stands a hill\nWhere thou mayst live, if such thy will:\nA holy mount, exceeding fair;\nGreat saints have made their dwelling there:\nThere great Langúrs  in thousands play,\nAnd bears amid the thickets stray;\nWide-known by Chitrakúṭa's name,\nIt rivals Gandhamádan's  fame.\nLong as the man that hill who seeks\nGazes upon its sacred peaks,\nTo holy things his soul he gives\nAnd pure from thought of evil lives.\nThere, while a hundred autumns fled,\nHas many a saint with hoary head\nSpent his pure life, and won the prize,\nBy deep devotion, in the skies:\nBest home, I ween, if such retreat,\nFar from the ways of men, be sweet:\nOr let thy years of exile flee\nHere in this hermitage with me.”\nThus Bharadvája spake, and trained\nIn lore of duty, entertained\nThe princes and the dame, and pressed\nHis friendly gifts on every guest.\nThus to Prayág the hero went,\nThus saw the saint preëminent,\nAnd varied speeches heard and said:\nThen holy night o'er heaven was spread.\nAnd Ráma took, by toil oppressed,\nWith Sítá and his brother, rest;\nAnd so the night, with sweet content,\nIn Bharadvája's grove was spent.\nBut when the dawn dispelled the night,\nRáma approached the anchorite,\nAnd thus addressed the holy sire\nWhose glory shone like kindled fire:\n“Well have we spent, O truthful Sage,\nThe night within thy hermitage:\nNow let my lord his guests permit\nFor their new home his grove to quit.”\nThen, as he saw the morning break,\nIn answer Bharadvája spake:\n“Go forth to Chitrakúṭa's hill,\nWhere berries grow, and sweets distil:\nFull well, I deem, that home will suit\nThee, Ráma, strong and resolute.\nGo forth, and Chitrakúṭa seek,\nFamed mountain of the Varied Peak.\nIn the wild woods that gird him round\nAll creatures of the chase are found:\nThou in the glades shalt see appear\nVast herds of elephants and deer.\nWith Sítá there shalt thou delight\nTo gaze upon the woody height;\nThere with expanding heart to look\nOn river, table-land, and brook,\nAnd see the foaming torrent rave\nImpetuous from the mountain cave.\nAuspicious hill! where all day long\nThe lapwing's cry, the Koïl's song\nMake all who listen gay:\nWhere all is fresh and fair to see,\nWhere elephants and deer roam free,\nThere, as a hermit, stay.”</code>"

Allow\nMy husband to complete his vow;\nLet us returning, I entreat,\nKauśalyá and Sumitrá meet.”\nThen with her hands together placed\nAround the tree she duly paced.\nWhen Ráma saw his blameless spouse\nA suppliant under holy boughs,\nThe gentle darling of his heart,\nHe thus to Lakshmaṇ spake apart:\n“Brother, by thee our way be led;\nLet Sítá close behind thee tread:\nI, best of men, will grasp my bow,\nAnd hindmost of the three will go.\nWhat fruits soe'er her fancy take,\nOr flowers half hidden in the brake,\nFor Janak's child forget not thou\nTo gather from the brake or bough.”\nThus on they fared. The tender dame\nAsked Ráma, as they walked, the name\nOf every shrub that blossoms bore,\nCreeper, and tree unseen before:\nAnd Lakshmaṇ fetched, at Sítá's prayer,\nBoughs of each tree with clusters fair.\nThen Janak's daughter joyed to see\nThe sand-discoloured river flee,\nWhere the glad cry of many a bird,\nThe sáras and the swan, was heard.\nA league the brothers travelled through\nThe forest noble game they slew:\nBeneath the trees their meal they dressed\nAnd sat them down to eat and rest.\nA while in that delightful shade\nWhere elephants unnumbered strayed,\nWhere peacocks screamed and monkeys played,\nThey wandered with delight.\nThen by the river's side they found\nA pleasant spot of level ground,\nWhere all was smooth and fair around,\nTheir lodging for the night.</code>"

each flowery tree\nTouched with the fire of morning see:\nThe Kinśuk, now the Frosts are fled,—\nHow glorious with his wreaths of red!\nThe Bel-trees see, so loved of men,\nHanging their boughs in every glen.\nO'erburthened with their fruit and flowers:\nA plenteous store of food is ours.\nSee, Lakshmaṇ, in the leafy trees,\nWhere'er they make their home.\nDown hangs, the work of labouring bees\nThe ponderous honeycomb.\nIn the fair wood before us spread\nThe startled wild-cock cries:\nHark, where the flowers are soft to tread,\nThe peacock's voice replies.\nWhere elephants are roaming free,\nAnd sweet birds' songs are loud,\nThe glorious Chitrakúṭa see:\nHis peaks are in the cloud.\nOn fair smooth ground he stands displayed,\nBegirt by many a tree:\nO brother, in that holy shade\nHow happy shall we be!” \nThen Ráma, Lakshmaṇ, Sítá, each\nSpoke raising suppliant hands this speech\nTo him, in woodland dwelling met,\nVálmíki, ancient anchoret:\n“O Saint, this mountain takes the mind,\nWith creepers, trees of every kind,\nWith fruit and roots abounding thus,\nA pleasant life it offers us:\nHere for a while we fain would stay,\nAnd pass a season blithe and gay.”\nThen the great saint, in duty trained,\nWith honour gladly entertained:\nHe gave his guests a welcome fair,\nAnd bade them sit and rest them there,\nRáma of mighty arm and chest\nHis faithful Lakshmaṇ then addressed:\n“Brother, bring hither from the wood\nSelected timber strong and good,\nAnd build therewith a little cot;\nMy heart rejoices in the spot\nThat lies beneath the mountain's side,\nRemote, with water well supplied.”\nSumitrá's son his words obeyed,\nBrought many a tree, and deftly made,\nWith branches in the forest cut,\nAs Ráma bade, a leafy hut.\nThen Ráma, when the cottage stood\nFair, firmly built, and walled with wood,\nTo Lakshmaṇ spake, whose eager mind\nTo do his brother's will inclined:\n“Now, Lakshmaṇ as our cot is made,\nMust sacrifice be duly paid\nBy us, for lengthened life who hope,\nWith venison of the antelope.\nAway, O bright-eyed Lakshmaṇ, speed:\nStruck by thy bow a deer must bleed:\nAs Scripture bids, we must not slight\nThe duty that commands the rite.”\nLakshmaṇ, the chief whose arrows laid\nHis foemen low, his word obeyed;\nAnd Ráma thus again addressed\nThe swift performer of his hest:\n“Prepare the venison thou hast shot,\nTo sacrifice for this our cot.\nHaste, brother dear, for this the hour,\nAnd this the day of certain power.”\nThen glorious Lakshmaṇ took the buck\nHis arrow in the wood had struck;\nBearing his mighty load he came,\nAnd laid it in the kindled flame.\nSoon as he saw the meat was done,\nAnd that the juices ceased to run\nFrom the broiled carcass, Lakshmaṇ then\nSpoke thus to Ráma best of men:\n“The carcass of the buck, entire,\nIs ready dressed upon the fire.\nNow be the sacred rites begun\nTo please the God, thou godlike one.”\nRáma the good, in ritual trained,\nPure from the bath, with thoughts restrained,\nHasted those verses to repeat\nWhich make the sacrifice complete.\nThe hosts celestial came in view,\nAnd Ráma to the cot withdrew,\nWhile a sweet sense of rapture stole\nThrough the unequalled hero's soul.\nHe paid the Viśvedevas  due.\nAnd Rudra's right, and Vishṇu's too,\nNor wonted blessings, to protect\nTheir new-built home, did he neglect.\nWith voice repressed he breathed the prayer,\nBathed duly in the river fair,\nAnd gave good offerings that remove\nThe stain of sin, as texts approve.\nAnd many an altar there he made,\nAnd shrines, to suit the holy shade,\nAll decked with woodland chaplets sweet,\nAnd fruit and roots and roasted meat,\nWith muttered prayer, as texts require,\nWater, and grass and wood and fire.\nSo Ráma, Lakshmaṇ, Sítá paid\nTheir offerings to each God and shade,\nAnd entered then their pleasant cot\nThat bore fair signs of happy lot.\nThey entered, the illustrious three,\nThe well-set cottage, fair to see,\nRoofed with the leaves of many a tree,\nAnd fenced from wind and rain:\nSo, at their Father Brahmá's call,\nThe Gods of heaven, assembling all,\nTo their own glorious council hall\nAdvance in shining train.\nSo, resting on that lovely hill,\nNear the fair lily-covered rill,\nThe happy prince forgot,\nSurrounded by the birds and deer,\nThe woe, the longing, and the fear\nThat gloom the exile's lot.</code>"

mournful fate\nOn Daśaratha, good and great\nAs Indra, pressed with crushing weight,\nAs when the demon's might assails\nThe Sun-God, and his glory pales.\nEre yet the sixth long night was spent,\nSince Ráma to the woods was sent,\nThe king at midnight sadly thought\nOf the old crime his hand had wrought,\nAnd thus to Queen Kauśalyá cried\nWho still for Ráma moaned and sighed:\n“If thou art waking, give, I pray,\nAttention to the words I say.\nWhate'er the conduct men pursue,\nBe good or ill the acts they do,\nBe sure, dear Queen, they find the meed\nOf wicked or of virtuous deed.\nA heedless child we call the man\nWhose feeble judgment fails to scan\nThe weight of what his hands may do,\nIts lightness, fault, and merit too.\nOne lays the Mango garden low,\nAnd bids the gay Paláśas grow:\nLonging for fruit their bloom he sees,\nBut grieves when fruit should bend the trees.\nCut by my hand, my fruit-trees fell,\nPaláśa trees I watered well.\nMy hopes this foolish heart deceive,\nAnd for my banished son I grieve.\nKauśalyá, in my youthful prime\nArmed with my bow I wrought the crime,\nProud of my skill, my name renowned,\nAn archer prince who shoots by sound.\nThe deed this hand unwitting wrought\nThis misery on my soul has brought,\nAs children seize the deadly cup\nAnd blindly drink the poison up.\nAs the unreasoning man may be\nCharmed with the gay Paláśa tree,\nI unaware have reaped the fruit\nOf joying at a sound to shoot.\nAs regent prince I shared the throne,\nThou wast a maid to me unknown,\nThe early Rain-time duly came,\nAnd strengthened love's delicious flame.\nThe sun had drained the earth that lay\nAll glowing 'neath the summer day,\nAnd to the gloomy clime had fled\nWhere dwell the spirits of the dead. \nThe fervent heat that moment ceased,\nThe darkening clouds each hour increased\nAnd frogs and deer and peacocks all\nRejoiced to see the torrents fall.\nTheir bright wings heavy from the shower,\nThe birds, new-bathed, had scarce the power\nTo reach the branches of the trees\nWhose high tops swayed beneath the breeze.\nThe fallen rain, and falling still,\nHung like a sheet on every hill,\nTill, with glad deer, each flooded steep\nShowed glorious as the mighty deep.\nThe torrents down its wooded side\nPoured, some unstained, while others dyed\nGold, ashy, silver, ochre, bore\nThe tints of every mountain ore.\nIn that sweet time, when all are pleased,\nMy arrows and my bow I seized;\nKeen for the chase, in field or grove,\nDown Sarjú's bank my car I drove.\nI longed with all my lawless will\nSome elephant by night to kill,\nSome buffalo that came to drink,\nOr tiger, at the river's brink.\nWhen all around was dark and still,\nI heard a pitcher slowly fill,\nAnd thought, obscured in deepest shade,\nAn elephant the sound had made.\nI drew a shaft that glittered bright,\nFell as a serpent's venomed bite;\nI longed to lay the monster dead,\nAnd to the mark my arrow sped.\nThen in the calm of morning, clear\nA hermit's wailing smote my ear:\n“Ah me, ah me,” he cried, and sank,\nPierced by my arrow, on the bank.\nE'en as the weapon smote his side,\nI heard a human voice that cried:\n“Why lights this shaft on one like me,\nA poor and harmless devotee?\nI came by night to fill my jar\nFrom this lone stream where no men are.\nAh, who this deadly shaft has shot?\nWhom have I wronged, and knew it not?\nWhy should a boy so harmless feel\nThe vengeance of the winged steel?\nOr who should slay the guiltless son\nOf hermit sire who injures none,\nWho dwells retired in woods, and there\nSupports his life on woodland fare?\nAh me, ah me, why am I slain,\nWhat booty will the murderer gain?\nIn hermit coils I bind my hair,\nCoats made of skin and bark I wear.\nAh, who the cruel deed can praise\nWhose idle toil no fruit repays,\nAs impious as the wretch's crime\nWho dares his master's bed to climb?\nNor does my parting spirit grieve\nBut for the life which thus I leave:\nAlas, my mother and my sire,—\nI mourn for them when I expire.\nAh me, that aged, helpless pair,\nLong cherished by my watchful care,\nHow will it be with them this day\nWhen to the Five  I pass away?\nPierced by the self-same dart we die,\nMine aged mother, sire, and I.\nWhose mighty hand, whose lawless mind\nHas all the three to death consigned?”\nWhen I, by love of duty stirred,\nThat touching lamentation heard,\nPierced to the heart by sudden woe,\nI threw to earth my shafts and bow.\nMy heart was full of grief and dread\nAs swiftly to the place I sped,\nWhere, by my arrow wounded sore,\nA hermit lay on Sarjú's shore.\nHis matted hair was all unbound,\nHis pitcher empty on the ground,\nAnd by the fatal arrow pained,\nHe lay with dust and gore distained.\nI stood confounded and amazed:\nHis dying eyes to mine he raised,\nAnd spoke this speech in accents stern,\nAs though his light my soul would burn:\n“How have I wronged thee, King, that I\nStruck by thy mortal arrow die?\nThe wood my home, this jar I brought,\nAnd water for my parents sought.\nThis one keen shaft that strikes me through\nSlays sire and aged mother too.\nFeeble and blind, in helpless pain,\nThey wait for me and thirst in vain.\nThey with parched lips their pangs must bear,\nAnd hope will end in blank despair.\nAh me, there seems no fruit in store\nFor holy zeal or Scripture lore,\nOr else ere now my sire would know\nThat his dear son is lying low.\nYet, if my mournful fate he knew,\nWhat could his arm so feeble do?\nThe tree, firm-rooted, ne'er may be\nThe guardian of a stricken tree.\nHaste to my father, and relate\nWhile time allows, my sudden fate,\nLest he consume thee as the fire\nBurns up the forest, in his ire.\nThis little path, O King, pursue:\nMy father's cot thou soon wilt view.\nThere sue for pardon to the sage,\nLest he should curse thee in his rage.\nFirst from the wound extract the dart\nThat kills me with its deadly smart,\nE'en as the flushed impetuous tide\nEats through the river's yielding side.”\nI feared to draw the arrow out,\nAnd pondered thus in painful doubt:\n“Now tortured by the shaft he lies,\nBut if I draw it forth he dies.”\nHelpless I stood, faint, sorely grieved:\nThe hermit's son my thought perceived;\nAs one o'ercome by direst pain\nHe scarce had strength to speak again.\nWith writhing limb and struggling breath,\nNearer and ever nearer death\n“My senses undisturbed remain,\nAnd fortitude has conquered pain:\nNow from one tear thy soul be freed.\nThy hand has made a Bráhman bleed.\nLet not this pang thy bosom wring:\nNo twice-born youth am I, O King,\nFor of a Vaiśya sire I came,\nWho wedded with a Śúdra dame.”\nThese words the boy could scarcely say,\nAs tortured by the shaft he lay,\nTwisting his helpless body round,\nThen trembling senseless on the ground.\nThen from his bleeding side I drew\nThe rankling shaft that pierced him through.\nWith death's last fear my face he eyed,\nAnd, rich in store of penance, died.”</code>"

wrought\nPerplexed me with remorseful thought,\nAnd all alone I pondered still\nHow kindly deed might salve the ill.\nThe pitcher from the ground I took,\nAnd filled it from that fairest brook,\nThen, by the path the hermit showed,\nI reached his sainted sire's abode.\nI came, I saw: the aged pair,\nFeeble and blind, were sitting there,\nLike birds with clipped wings, side by side,\nWith none their helpless steps to guide.\nTheir idle hours the twain beguiled\nWith talk of their returning child,\nAnd still the cheering hope enjoyed,\nThe hope, alas, by me destroyed.\nThen spoke the sage, as drawing near\nThe sound of footsteps reached his ear:\n“Dear son, the water quickly bring;\nWhy hast thou made this tarrying?\nThy mother thirsts, and thou hast played,\nAnd bathing in the brook delayed.\nShe weeps because thou camest not;\nHaste, O my son, within the cot.\nIf she or I have ever done\nA thing to pain thee, dearest son,\nDismiss the memory from thy mind:\nA hermit thou, be good and kind.\nOn thee our lives, our all, depend:\nThou art thy friendless parents' friend.\nThe eyeless couple's eye art thou:\nThen why so cold and silent now?”\nWith sobbing voice and bosom wrung\nI scarce could move my faltering tongue,\nAnd with my spirit filled with dread\nI looked upon the sage, and said,\nWhile mind, and sense, and nerve I strung\nTo fortify my trembling tongue,\nAnd let the aged hermit know\nHis son's sad fate, my fear and woe:\n“High-minded Saint, not I thy child,\nA warrior, Daśaratha styled.\nI bear a grievous sorrow's weight\nBorn of a deed which good men hate.\nMy lord, I came to Sarjú's shore,\nAnd in my hand my bow I bore\nFor elephant or beast of chase\nThat seeks by night his drinking place.\nThere from the stream a sound I heard\nAs if a jar the water stirred.\nAn elephant, I thought, was nigh:\nI aimed, and let an arrow fly.\nSwift to the place I made my way,\nAnd there a wounded hermit lay\nGasping for breath: the deadly dart\nStood quivering in his youthful heart.\nI hastened near with pain oppressed;\nHe faltered out his last behest.\nAnd quickly, as he bade me do,\nFrom his pierced side the shaft I drew.\nI drew the arrow from the rent,\nAnd up to heaven the hermit went,\nLamenting, as from earth he passed,\nHis aged parents to the last.\nThus, unaware, the deed was done:\nMy hand, unwitting, killed thy son.\nFor what remains, O, let me win\nThy pardon for my heedless sin.”\nAs the sad tale of sin I told\nThe hermit's grief was uncontrolled.\nWith flooded eyes, and sorrow-faint,\nThus spake the venerable saint:\nI stood with hand to hand applied,\nAnd listened as he spoke and sighed:\n“If thou, O King, hadst left unsaid\nBy thine own tongue this tale of dread,\nThy head for hideous guilt accursed\nHad in a thousand pieces burst.\nA hermit's blood by warrior spilt,\nIn such a case, with purposed guilt,\nDown from his high estate would bring\nEven the thunder's mighty King.\nAnd he a dart who conscious sends\nAgainst the devotee who spends\nHis pure life by the law of Heaven—\nThat sinner's head will split in seven.\nThou livest, for thy heedless hand\nHas wrought a deed thou hast not planned,\nElse thou and all of Raghu's line\nHad perished by this act of thine.\nNow guide us,” thus the hermit said,\n“Forth to the spot where he lies dead.\nGuide us, this day, O Monarch, we\nFor the last time our son would see:\nThe hermit dress of skin he wore\nRent from his limbs distained with gore;\nHis senseless body lying slain,\nHis soul in Yama's dark domain.”\nAlone the mourning pair I led,\nTheir souls with woe disquieted,\nAnd let the dame and hermit lay\nTheir hands upon the breathless clay.\nThe father touched his son, and pressed\nThe body to his aged breast;\nThen falling by the dead boy's side,\nHe lifted up his voice, and cried:\n“Hast thou no word, my child, to say?\nNo greeting for thy sire to-day?\nWhy art thou angry, darling? why\nWilt thou upon the cold earth lie?\nIf thou, my son, art wroth with me,\nHere, duteous child, thy mother see.\nWhat! no embrace for me, my son?\nNo word of tender love—not one?\nWhose gentle voice, so soft and clear,\nSoothing my spirit, shall I hear\nWhen evening comes, with accents sweet\nScripture or ancient lore repeat?\nWho, having fed the sacred fire,\nAnd duly bathed, as texts require,\nWill cheer, when evening rites are done,\nThe father mourning for his son?\nWho will the daily meal provide\nFor the poor wretch who lacks a guide,\nFeeding the helpless with the best\nBerries and roots, like some dear guest?\nHow can these hands subsistence find\nFor thy poor mother, old and blind?\nThe wretched votaress how sustain,\nWho mourns her child in ceaseless pain?\nStay yet a while, my darling, stay,\nNor fly to Yama's realm to-day.\nTo-morrow I thy sire and she\nWho bare thee, child, will go with, thee. \nThen when I look on Yama, I\nTo great Vivasvat's son will cry:\n“Hear, King of justice, and restore\nOur child to feed us, I implore.\nLord of the world, of mighty fame,\nFaithful and just, admit my claim,\nAnd grant this single boon to free\nMy soul from fear, to one like me.”\nBecause, my son, untouched by stain,\nBy sinful hands thou fallest slain,\nWin, through thy truth, the sphere where those\nWho die by hostile darts repose.\nSeek the blest home prepared for all\nThe valiant who in battle fall,\nWho face the foe and scorn to yield,\nIn glory dying on the field.\nRise to the heaven where Dhundhumár\nAnd Nahush, mighty heroes, are,\nWhere Janamejay and the blest\nDilípa, Sagar, Saivya, rest:\nHome of all virtuous spirits, earned\nBy fervent rites and Scripture learned:\nBy those whose sacred fires have glowed,\nWhose liberal hands have fields bestowed:\nBy givers of a thousand cows,\nBy lovers of one faithful spouse:\nBy those who serve their masters well,\nAnd cast away this earthly shell.\nNone of my race can ever know\nThe bitter pain of lasting woe.\nBut doomed to that dire fate is he\nWhose guilty hand has slaughtered thee.”\nThus with wild tears the aged saint\nMade many a time his piteous plaint,\nThen with his wife began to shed\nThe funeral water for the dead.\nBut in a shape celestial clad,\nWon by the merits of the lad,\nThe spirit from the body brake\nAnd to the mourning parents spake:\n“A glorious home in realms above\nRewards my care and filial love.\nYou, honoured parents, soon shall be\nPartakers of that home with me.”\nHe spake, and swiftly mounting high,\nWith Indra near him, to the sky\nOn a bright car, with flame that glowed,\nSublime the duteous hermit rode.\nThe father, with his consort's aid,\nThe funeral rites with water paid,\nAnd thus his speech to me renewed\nWho stood in suppliant attitude:\n“Slay me this day, O, slay me, King,\nFor death no longer has a sting.\nChildless am I: thy dart has done\nTo death my dear, my only son.\nBecause the boy I loved so well\nSlain by thy heedless arrow fell,\nMy curse upon thy soul shall press\nWith bitter woe and heaviness.\nI mourn a slaughtered child, and thou\nShalt feel the pangs that kill me now.\nBereft and suffering e'en as I,\nSo shalt thou mourn thy son, and die.\nThy hand unwitting dealt the blow\nThat laid a holy hermit low,\nAnd distant, therefore, is the time\nWhen thou shalt suffer for the crime.\nThe hour shall come when, crushed by woes\nLike these I feel, thy life shall close:\nA debt to pay in after days\nLike his the priestly fee who pays.”\nThis curse on me the hermit laid,\nNor yet his tears and groans were stayed.\nThen on the pyre their bodies cast\nThe pair; and straight to heaven they passed.\nAs in sad thought I pondered long\nBack to my memory came the wrong\nDone in wild youth, O lady dear,\nWhen 'twas my boast to shoot by ear.\nThe deed has borne the fruit, which now\nHangs ripe upon the bending bough:\nThus dainty meats the palate please,\nAnd lure the weak to swift disease.\nNow on my soul return with dread\nThe words that noble hermit said,\nThat I for a dear son should grieve,\nAnd of the woe my life should leave.”\nThus spake the king with many a tear;\nThen to his wife he cried in fear:\n“I cannot see thee, love; but lay\nThy gentle hand in mine, I pray.\nAh me, if Ráma touched me thus,\nIf once, returning home to us,\nHe bade me wealth and lordship give,\nThen, so I think, my soul would live.\nUnlike myself, unjust and mean\nHave been my ways with him, my Queen,\nBut like himself is all that he,\nMy noble son, has done to me.\nHis son, though far from right he stray,\nWhat prudent sire would cast away?\nWhat banished son would check his ire,\nNor speak reproaches of his sire?\nI see thee not: these eyes grow blind,\nAnd memory quits my troubled mind.\nAngels of Death are round me: they\nSummon my soul with speed away.\nWhat woe more grievous can there be,\nThat, when from light and life I flee,\nI may not, ere I part, behold\nMy virtuous Ráma, true and bold?\nGrief for my son, the brave and true,\nWhose joy it was my will to do,\nDries up my breath, as summer dries\nThe last drop in the pool that lies.\nNot men, but blessed Gods, are they\nWhose eyes shall see his face that day;\nSee him, when fourteen years are past,\nWith earrings decked return at last.\nMy fainting mind forgets to think:\nLow and more low my spirits sink.\nEach from its seat, my senses steal:\nI cannot hear, or taste, or feel.\nThis lethargy of soul o'ercomes\nEach organ, and its function numbs:\nSo when the oil begins to fail,\nThe torch's rays grow faint and pale.\nThis flood of woe caused by this hand\nDestroys me helpless and unmanned,\nResistless as the floods that bore\nA passage through the river shore.\nAh Raghu's son, ah mighty-armed,\nBy whom my cares were soothed and charmed,\nMy son in whom I took delight,\nNow vanished from thy father's sight!\nKauśalyá, ah, I cannot see;\nSumitrá, gentle devotee!\nAlas, Kaikeyí, cruel dame,\nMy bitter foe, thy father's shame!”\nKauśalyá and Sumitrá kept\nTheir watch beside him as he wept.\nAnd Daśaratha moaned and sighed,\nAnd grieving for his darling died.</code>"

fast,\nAkurvatí's fair stream he passed,\nCrossed o'er Ágneya's rapid rill,\nAnd Śalyakartan onward still.\nŚilávahá's swift stream he eyed,\nTrue to his vows and purified,\nThen crossed the lofty hills, and stood\nIn Chaitraratha's mighty wood.\nHe reached the confluence where meet\nSarasvatí  and Gangá fleet,\nAnd through Bháruṇḍa forest, spread\nNorthward of Viramatsya, sped.\nHe sought Kálinda's child, who fills\nThe soul with joy, begirt by hills,\nReached Yamuná, and passing o'er,\nRested his army on the shore:\nHe gave his horses food and rest,\nBathed reeking limb and drooping crest.\nThey drank their fill and bathed them there,\nAnd water for their journey bare.\nThence through a mighty wood he sped\nAll wild and uninhabited,\nAs in fair chariot through the skies,\nMost fair in shape a Storm-God flies.\nAt Anśudhána Gangá, hard\nTo cross, his onward journey barred,\nSo turning quickly thence he came\nTo Prágvaṭ's city dear to fame.\nThere having gained the farther side\nTo Kuṭikoshṭiká he hied:\nThe stream he crossed, and onward then\nTo Dharmavardhan brought his men.\nThence, leaving Toraṇ on the north,\nTo Jambuprastha journeyed forth.\nThen onward to a pleasant grove\nBy fair Varútha's town he drove,\nAnd when a while he there had stayed,\nWent eastward from the friendly shade.\nEastward of Ujjiháná where\nThe Priyak trees are tall and fair,\nHe passed, and rested there each steed\nExhausted with the journey's speed.\nThere orders to his men addressed,\nWith quickened pace he onward pressed,\nA while at Sarvatírtha spent,\nThen o'er Uttániká he went.\nO'er many a stream beside he sped\nWith coursers on the mountains bred,\nAnd passing Hastiprishṭhak, took\nThe road o'er Kuṭiká's fair brook.\nThen, at Lohitya's village, he\nCrossed o'er the swift Kapívatí,\nThen passed, where Ekaśála stands,\nThe Stháṇumatí's flood and sands,\nAnd Gomatí of fair renown\nBy Vinata's delightful town.\nWhen to Kalinga near he drew,\nA wood of Sal trees charmed the view;\nThat passed, the sun began to rise,\nAnd Bharat saw with happy eyes,\nAyodhyá's city, built and planned\nBy ancient Manu's royal hand.\nSeven nights upon the road had passed,\nAnd when he saw the town at last\nBefore him in her beauty spread,\nThus Bharat to the driver said:\n“This glorious city from afar,\nWherein pure groves and gardens are,\nSeems to my eager eyes to-day\nA lifeless pile of yellow clay.\nThrough all her streets where erst a throng\nOf men and women streamed along,\nUprose the multitudinous roar:\nTo-day I hear that sound no more.\nNo longer do mine eyes behold\nThe leading people, as of old,\nOn elephants, cars, horses, go\nAbroad and homeward, to and fro.\nThe brilliant gardens, where we heard\nThe wild note of each rapturous bird,\nWhere men and women loved to meet,\nIn pleasant shades, for pastime sweet,—\nThese to my eyes this day appear\nJoyless, and desolate, and drear:\nEach tree that graced the garden grieves,\nAnd every path is spread with leaves.\nThe merry cry of bird and beast,\nThat spake aloud their joy, has ceased:\nStill is the long melodious note\nThat charmed us from each warbling throat.\nWhy blows the blessed air no more,\nThe incense-breathing air that bore\nIts sweet incomparable scent\nOf sandal and of aloe blent?\nWhy are the drum and tabour mute?\nWhy is the music of the lute\nThat woke responsive to the quill,\nLoved by the happy, hushed and still?\nMy boding spirit gathers hence\nDire sins of awful consequence,\nAnd omens, crowding on my sight,\nWeigh down my soul with wild affright.\nScarce shall I find my friends who dwell\nHere in Ayodhyá safe and well:\nFor surely not without a cause\nThis crushing dread my soul o'erawes.”\nHeart sick, dejected, every sense\nConfused by terror's influence,\nOn to the town he quickly swept\nWhich King Ikshváku's children kept.\nHe passed through Vaijayanta's gate,\nWith weary steeds, disconsolate,\nAnd all who near their station held,\nHis escort, crying Victory, swelled,\nWith heart distracted still he bowed\nFarewell to all the following crowd,\nTurned to the driver and began\nTo question thus the weary man:\n“Why was I brought, O free from blame,\nSo fast, unknown for what I came?\nYet fear of ill my heart appals,\nAnd all my wonted courage falls.\nFor I have heard in days gone by\nThe changes seen when monarchs die;\nAnd all those signs, O charioteer,\nI see to-day surround me here:\nEach kinsman's house looks dark and grim,\nNo hand delights to keep it trim:\nThe beauty vanished, and the pride,\nThe doors, unkept, stand open wide.\nNo morning rites are offered there,\nNo grateful incense loads the air,\nAnd all therein, with brows o'ercast,\nSit joyless on the ground and fast.\nTheir lovely chaplets dry and dead,\nTheir courts unswept, with dust o'erspread,\nThe temples of the Gods to-day\nNo more look beautiful and gay.\nNeglected stands each holy shrine,\nEach image of a Lord divine.\nNo shop where flowery wreaths are sold\nIs bright and busy as of old.\nThe women and the men I mark\nAbsorbed in fancies dull and dark,\nTheir gloomy eyes with tears bedewed,\nA poor afflicted multitude.”\nHis mind oppressed with woe and dread,\nThus Bharat to his driver said,\nViewed the dire signs Ayodhyá showed,\nAnd onward to the palace rode.</code>"

I crave\nTo hear the last advice he gave.”\nThus closely questioned by the youth,\nKaikeyí spoke the mournful truth:\n“The high-souled monarch wept and sighed,\nFor Ráma, Sítá, Lakshmaṇ, cried,\nThen, best of all who go to bliss,\nPassed to the world which follows this.\n“Ah, blessed are the people who\nShall Ráma and his Sítá view,\nAnd Lakshmaṇ of the mighty arm,\nReturning free from scathe and harm.”\nSuch were the words, the last of all,\nThy father, ere he died, let fall,\nBy Fate and Death's dread coils enwound,\nAs some great elephant is bound.”\nHe heard, yet deeper in despair,\nHer lips this double woe declare,\nAnd with sad brow that showed his pain\nQuestioned his mother thus again:\n“But where is he, of virtue tried,\nWho fills Kauśalyá's heart with pride,\nWhere is the noble Ráma? where\nIs Lakshmaṇ brave, and Sítá fair?”\nThus pressed, the queen began to tell\nThe story as each thing befell,\nAnd gave her son in words like these,\nThe mournful news she meant to please:\n“The prince is gone in hermit dress\nTo Daṇḍak's mighty wilderness,\nAnd Lakshmaṇ brave and Sítá share\nThe wanderings of the exile there.”\nThen Bharat's soul with fear was stirred\nLest Ráma from the right had erred,\nAnd jealous for ancestral fame,\nHe put this question to the dame:\n“Has Ráma grasped with lawless hold\nA Bráhman's house, or land, or gold?\nHas Ráma harmed with ill intent\nSome poor or wealthy innocent?\nWas Ráma, faithless to his vows,\nEnamoured of anothers spouse?\nWhy was he sent to Daṇḍak's wild,\nLike one who kills an unborn child?”\nHe questioned thus: and she began\nTo tell her deeds and crafty plan.\nDeceitful-hearted, fond, and blind\nAs is the way of womankind:\n“No Bráhman's wealth has Ráma seized,\nNo dame his wandering fancy pleased;\nHis very eyes he ne'er allows\nTo gaze upon a neighbour's spouse.\nBut when I heard the monarch planned\nTo give the realm to Ráma's hand,\nI prayed that Ráma hence might flee,\nAnd claimed the throne, my son, for thee.\nThe king maintained the name he bare,\nAnd did according to my prayer,\nAnd Ráma, with his brother, sent,\nAnd Sítá, forth to banishment.\nWhen his dear son was seen no more,\nThe lord of earth was troubled sore:\nToo feeble with his grief to strive,\nHe joined the elemental Five.\nUp then, most dutiful! maintain\nThe royal state, arise, and reign.\nFor thee, my darling son, for thee\nAll this was planned and wrought by me.\nCome, cast thy grief and pain aside,\nWith manly courage fortified.\nThis town and realm are all thine own,\nAnd fear and grief are here unknown.\nCome, with Vaśishṭha's guiding aid,\nAnd priests in ritual skilled\nLet the king's funeral dues be paid,\nAnd every claim fulfilled.\nPerform his obsequies with all\nThat suits his rank and worth,\nThen give the mandate to install\nThyself as lord of earth.”</code>"

to her\nBefore each lord and minister:\n“No lust have I for kingly sway,\nMy mother I no more obey:\nNaught of this consecration knew\nWhich Daśaratha kept in view.\nI with Śatrughna all the time\nWas dwelling in a distant clime:\nI knew of Ráma's exile naught,\nThat hero of the noble thought:\nI knew not how fair Sítá went,\nAnd Lakshmaṇ, forth to banishment.”\nThus high-souled Bharat, mid the crowd,\nLifted his voice and cried aloud.\nKauśalyá heard, she raised her head,\nAnd quickly to Sumitrá said:\n“Bharat, Kaikeyí's son is here,—\nHers whose fell deeds I loathe and fear:\nThat youth of foresight keen I fain\nWould meet and see his face again.”\nThus to Sumitrá spake the dame,\nAnd straight to Bharat's presence came\nWith altered mien, neglected dress,\nTrembling and faint with sore distress.\nBharat, Śatrughna by his side,\nTo meet her, toward her palace hied.\nAnd when the royal dame they viewed\nDistressed with dire solicitude,\nSad, fallen senseless on the ground,\nAbout her neck their arms they wound.\nThe noble matron prostrate there,\nEmbraced, with tears, the weeping pair,\nAnd with her load of grief oppressed,\nTo Bharat then these words addressed:\n“Now all is thine, without a foe,\nThis realm for which thou longest so.\nAh, soon Kaikeyí's ruthless hand\nHas won the empire of the land,\nAnd made my guiltless Ráma flee\nDressed like some lonely devotee.\nHerein what profit has the queen,\nWhose eye delights in havoc, seen?\nMe also, me 'twere surely good\nTo banish to the distant wood,\nTo dwell amid the shades that hold\nMy famous son with limbs like gold.\nNay, with the sacred fire to guide,\nWill I, Sumitrá by my side,\nMyself to the drear wood repair\nAnd seek the son of Raghu there.\nThis land which rice and golden corn\nAnd wealth of every kind adorn,\nCar, elephant, and steed, and gem,—\nShe makes thee lord of it and them.”\nWith taunts like these her bitter tongue\nThe heart of blameless Bharat wrung\nAnd direr pangs his bosom tore\nThan when the lancet probes a sore.\nWith troubled senses all astray\nProne at her feet he fell and lay.\nWith loud lament a while he plained,\nAnd slowly strength and sense regained.\nWith suppliant hand to hand applied\nHe turned to her who wept and sighed,\nAnd thus bespake the queen, whose breast\nWith sundry woes was sore distressed:\n“Why these reproaches, noble dame?\nI, knowing naught, am free from blame.\nThou knowest well what love was mine\nFor Ráma, chief of Raghu's line.\nO, never be his darkened mind\nTo Scripture's guiding lore inclined,\nBy whose consent the prince who led\nThe good, the truthful hero, fled.\nMay he obey the vilest lord,\nOffend the sun with act abhorred, \nAnd strike a sleeping cow, who lent\nHis voice to Ráma's banishment.\nMay the good king who all befriends,\nAnd, like his sons, the people tends,\nBe wronged by him who gave consent\nTo noble Ráma's banishment.\nOn him that king's injustice fall,\nWho takes, as lord, a sixth of all,\nNor guards, neglectful of his trust,\nHis people, as a ruler must.\nThe crime of those who swear to fee,\nAt holy rites, some devotee,\nAnd then the promised gift deny,\nBe his who willed the prince should fly.\nWhen weapons clash and heroes bleed,\nWith elephant and harnessed steed,\nNe'er, like the good, be his to fight\nWhose heart allowed the prince's flight.\nThough taught with care by one expert\nMay he the Veda's text pervert,\nWith impious mind on evil bent,\nWhose voice approved the banishment.\nMay he with traitor lips reveal\nWhate'er he promised to conceal,\nAnd bruit abroad his friend's offence,\nBetrayed by generous confidence.\nNo wife of equal lineage born\nThe wretch's joyless home adorn:\nNe'er may he do one virtuous deed,\nAnd dying see no child succeed.\nWhen in the battle's awful day\nFierce warriors stand in dread array,\nLet the base coward turn and fly,\nAnd smitten by the foeman, die.\nLong may he wander, rags his wear,\nDoomed in his hand a skull to bear,\nAnd like an idiot beg his bread,\nWho gave consent when Ráma fled.\nHis sin who holy rites forgets,\nAsleep when shows the sun and sets,\nA load upon his soul shall lie\nWhose will allowed the prince to fly.\nHis sin who loves his Master's dame,\nHis, kindler of destructive flame,\nHis who betrays his trusting friend\nShall, mingled all, on him descend.\nBy him no reverence due be paid\nTo blessed God or parted shade:\nMay sire and mother's sacred name\nIn vain from him obedience claim.\nNe'er may he go where dwell the good,\nNor win their fame and neighbourhood,\nBut lose all hopes of bliss to-day,\nWho willed the prince should flee away.\nMay he deceive the poor and weak\nWho look to him and comfort seek,\nBetray the suppliants who complain,\nAnd make the hopeful hope in vain.\nLong may his wife his kiss expect,\nAnd pine away in cold neglect.\nMay he his lawful love despise,\nAnd turn on other dames his eyes,\nFool, on forbidden joys intent,\nWhose will allowed the banishment.\nHis sin who deadly poison throws\nTo spoil the water as it flows,\nLay on the wretch its burden dread\nWho gave consent when Ráma fled.” \nThus with his words he undeceived\nKauśalyá's troubled heart, who grieved\nFor son and husband reft away;\nThen prostrate on the ground he lay.\nHim as he lay half-senseless there,\nFreed by the mighty oaths he sware,\nKauśalyá, by her woe distressed,\nWith melancholy words addressed:\n“Anew, my son, this sorrow springs\nTo rend my heart with keener stings:\nThese awful oaths which thou hast sworn\nMy breast with double grief have torn.\nThy soul, and faithful Lakshmaṇ's too,\nAre still, thank Heaven! to virtue true.\nTrue to thy promise, thou shalt gain\nThe mansions which the good obtain.”\nThen to her breast that youth she drew,\nWhose sweet fraternal love she knew,\nAnd there in strict embraces held\nThe hero, as her tears outwelled.\nAnd Bharat's heart grew sick and faint\nWith grief and oft-renewed complaint,\nAnd all his senses were distraught\nBy the great woe that in him wrought.\nThus he lay and still bewailed\nWith sighs and loud lament\nTill all his strength and reason failed,\nThe hours of night were spent.</code>"

I\nWill pass into the fire and die.\nAbandoned thus, I will not brook\nUpon Ayodhyá's town to look,\nOnce guarded by Ikshváku's race:\nThe wood shall be my dwelling place.”\nThen when the princes' mournful train\nHeard the sad brothers thus complain,\nAnd saw their misery, at the view\nTheir grief burst wilder out anew.\nFaint with lamenting, sad and worn,\nEach like a bull with broken horn,\nThe brothers in their wild despair\nLay rolling, mad with misery, there.\nThen old Vaśishṭha good and true,\nTheir father's priest, all lore who knew,\nRaised weeping Bharat on his feet,\nAnd thus bespake with counsel meet:\n“Twelve days, my lord, have past away\nSince flames consumed thy father's clay:\nDelay no more: as rules ordain,\nGather what bones may yet remain.\nThree constant pairs are ever found\nTo hem all mortal creatures round: \nThen mourn not thus, O Prince, for none\nTheir close companionship may shun.”\nSumantra bade Śatrughna rise,\nAnd soothed his soul with counsel wise,\nAnd skilled in truth, his hearer taught\nHow all things are and come to naught.\nWhen rose each hero from the ground,\nA lion lord of men, renowned,\nHe showed like Indra's flag,  whereon\nFierce rains have dashed and suns have shone.\nThey wiped their red and weeping eyes,\nAnd gently made their sad replies:\nThen, urged to haste, the royal pair\nPerformed the rites that claimed their care.</code>"

I will keep\nMy watch while Ráma lies asleep:\nFor in the whole wide world is none\nDearer to me than Raghu's son.\nHarbour no doubt or jealous fear:\nI speak the truth with heart sincere:\nFor from the grace which he has shown\nWill glory on my name be thrown:\nGreat store of merit shall I gain,\nAnd duteous, form no wish in vain.\nLet me enforced by many a row\nOf followers, armed with shaft and bow\nFor well-loved Ráma's weal provide\nWho lies asleep by Sítá's side.\nFor through this wood I often go,\nAnd all its shades conceal I know:\nAnd we with conquering arms can meet\nA four-fold host arrayed complete.”\n“With words like these I spoke, designed\nTo move the high-souled Bharat's mind,\nBut he upon his duty bent,\nPlied his persuasive argument:\n“O, how can slumber close mine eyes\nWhen lowly couched with Sítá lies\nThe royal Ráma? can I give\nMy heart to joy, or even live?\nHe whom no mighty demon, no,\nNor heavenly God can overthrow,\nSee, Guha, how he lies, alas,\nWith Sítá couched on gathered grass.\nBy varied labours, long, severe,\nBy many a prayer and rite austere,\nHe, Daśaratha's cherished son,\nBy Fortune stamped, from Heaven was won.\nNow as his son is forced to fly,\nThe king ere long will surely die:\nReft of his guardian hand, forlorn\nIn widowed grief this land will mourn.\nE'en now perhaps, with toil o'erspent,\nThe women cease their loud lament,\nAnd cries of woe no longer ring\nThroughout the palace of the king.\nBut ah for sad Kauśalyá! how\nFare she and mine own mother now?\nHow fares the king? this night, I think,\nSome of the three in death will sink.\nWith hopes upon Śatrughna set\nMy mother may survive as yet,\nBut the sad queen will die who bore\nThe hero, for her grief is sore.\nHis cherished wish that would have made\nDear Ráma king, so long delayed,\n“Too late! too late!” the king will cry,\nAnd conquered by his misery die.\nWhen Fate has brought the mournful day\nWhich sees my father pass away,\nHow happy in their lives are they\nAllowed his funeral rites to pay.\nOur exile o'er, with him who ne'er\nTurns from the oath his lips may swear,\nMay we returning safe and well\ngain in fair Ayodhyá dwell.”\nThus Bharat stood with many a sigh\nLamenting, and the night went by.\nSoon as the morning light shone fair\nIn votive coils both bound their hair.\nAnd then I sent them safely o'er\nAnd left them on the farther shore.\nWith Sítá then they onward passed,\nTheir coats of bark about them cast,\nTheir locks like hermits' bound,\nThe mighty tamers of the foe,\nEach with his arrows and his bow,\nWent over the rugged ground,\nProud in their strength and undeterred\nLike elephants that lead the herd,\nAnd gazing oft around.”</code>"

earnest wish: do thou\nThis longing of my heart allow,\nWhy hast thou hither bent thy way,\nAnd made thy troops behind thee stay?\nWhy unattended? couldst thou not\nWith friends and army seek this spot?”\nBharat, with reverent hands raised high,\nTo that great hermit made reply:\n“My troops, for awe of thee, O Sage,\nI brought not to thy hermitage:\nTroops of a king or monarch's son\nA hermit's home should ever shun.\nBehind me comes a mighty train\nWide spreading o'er the ample plain,\nWhere every chief and captain leads\nMen, elephants, and mettled steeds.\nI feared, O reverend Sage, lest these\nMight harm the holy ground and trees,\nSprings might be marred and cots o'erthrown,\nSo with the priests I came alone.”\n“Bring all thy host,” the hermit cried,\nAnd Bharat, to his joy, complied.\nThen to the chapel went the sire,\nWhere ever burnt the sacred fire,\nAnd first, in order due, with sips\nOf water purified his lips:\nTo Viśvakarmá, then he prayed,\nHis hospitable feast to aid:\n“Let Viśvakarmá hear my call,\nThe God who forms and fashions all:\nA mighty banquet I provide,\nBe all my wants this day supplied.\nLord Indra at their head, the three \nWho guard the worlds I call to me:\nA mighty host this day I feed,\nBe now supplied my every need.\nLet all the streams that eastward go,\nAnd those whose waters westering flow,\nBoth on the earth and in the sky,\nFlow hither and my wants supply.\nBe some with ardent liquor filled,\nAnd some with wine from flowers distilled,\nWhile some their fresh cool streams retain\nSweet as the juice of sugar-cane.\nI call the Gods, I call the band\nOf minstrels that around them stand:\nI call the Háhá and Huhú,\nI call the sweet Viśvávasu,\nI call the heavenly wives of these\nWith all the bright Apsarases,\nAlambúshá of beauty rare,\nThe charmer of the tangled hair,\nGhritáchí and Viśváchi fair,\nHemá and Bhímá sweet to view,\nAnd lovely Nágadantá too,\nAnd all the sweetest nymphs who stand\nBy Indra or by Brahmá's hand—\nI summon these with all their train\nAnd Tumburu to lead the strain.\nHere let Kuvera's garden rise\nWhich far in Northern Kuru  lies:\nFor leaves let cloth and gems entwine,\nAnd let its fruit be nymphs divine.\nLet Soma  give the noblest food\nTo feed the mighty multitude,\nOf every kind, for tooth and lip,\nTo chew, to lick, to suck, and sip.\nLet wreaths, where fairest flowers abound,\nSpring from the trees that bloom around.\nEach sort of wine to woo the taste,\nAnd meats of every kind be placed.”\nThus spake the hermit self-restrained,\nWith proper tone by rules ordained,\nOn deepest meditation bent,\nIn holy might preëminent.\nThen as with hands in reverence raised\nAbsorbed in thought he eastward gazed,\nThe deities he thus addressed\nCame each in semblance manifest.\nDelicious gales that cooled the frame\nFrom Malaya and Dardar came,\nThat kissed those scented hills and threw\nAuspicious fragrance where they blew.\nThen falling fast in sweetest showers\nCame from the sky immortal flowers,\nAnd all the airy region round\nWith heavenly drums was made to sound.\nThen breathed a soft celestial breeze,\nThen danced the bright Apsarases,\nThe minstrels and the Gods advanced,\nAnd warbling lutes the soul entranced.\nThe earth and sky that music filled,\nAnd through each ear it softly thrilled,\nAs from the heavenly quills it fell\nWith time and tune attempered well.\nSoon as the minstrels ceased to play\nAnd airs celestial died away,\nThe troops of Bharat saw amazed\nWhat Viśvakarmá's art had raised.\nOn every side, five leagues around,\nAll smooth and level lay the ground,\nWith fresh green grass that charmed the sight\nLike sapphires blent with lazulite.\nThere the Wood-apple hung its load,\nThe Mango and the Citron glowed,\nThe Bel and scented Jak were there,\nAnd Apelá with fruitage fair.\nThere, brought from Northern Kuru, stood\nRich in delights, the glorious wood,\nAnd many a stream was seen to glide\nWith flowering trees along its side.\nThere mansions rose with four wide halls,\nAnd elephants and chargers' stalls,\nAnd many a house of royal state,\nTriumphal arc and bannered gate.\nWith noble doorways, sought the sky,\nLike a pale cloud, a palace high,\nWhich far and wide rare fragrance shed,\nWith wreaths of white engarlanded.\nSquare was its shape, its halls were wide,\nWith many a seat and couch supplied,\nDrink of all kinds, and every meat\nSuch as celestial Gods might eat.\nThen at the bidding of the seer\nKaikeyí's strong-armed son drew near,\nAnd passed within that fair abode\nWhich with the noblest jewels glowed.\nThen, as Vaśishṭha led the way,\nThe councillors, in due array,\nFollowed delighted and amazed\nAnd on the glorious structure gazed.\nThen Bharat, Raghu's son, drew near\nThe kingly throne, with prince and peer,\nWhereby the chouri in the shade\nOf the white canopy was laid.\nBefore the throne he humbly bent\nAnd honoured Ráma, reverent,\nThen in his hand the chouri bore,\nAnd sat where sits a councillor.\nHis ministers and household priest\nSat by degrees from chief to least,\nThen sat the captain of the host\nAnd all the men he honoured most.\nThen when the saint his order gave,\nEach river with enchanted wave\nRolled milk and curds divinely sweet\nBefore the princely Bharat's feet;\nAnd dwellings fair on either side,\nWith gay white plaster beautified,\nTheir heavenly roofs were seen to lift,\nThe Bráhman Bharadvája's gift.\nThen straight by Lord Kuvera sent,\nGay with celestial ornament\nOf bright attire and jewels' shine,\nCame twenty thousand nymphs divine:\nThe man on whom those beauties glanced\nThat moment felt his soul entranced.\nWith them from Nandan's blissful shades\nCame twenty thousand heavenly maids.\nTumburu, Nárad, Gopa came,\nAnd Sutanu, like radiant flame,\nThe kings of the Gandharva throng,\nAnd ravished Bharat with their song.\nThen spoke the saint, and swift obeyed\nAlambúshá, the fairest maid,\nAnd Miśrakeśí bright to view,\nRamaṇá, Puṇḍríká too,\nAnd danced to him with graceful ease\nThe dances of Apsarases.\nAll chaplets that by Gods are worn,\nOr Chaitraratha's graves adorn,\nBloomed by the saint's command arrayed\nOn branches in Prayága's shade.\nWhen at the saint's command the breeze\nMade music with the Vilva trees,\nTo wave in rhythmic beat began\nThe boughs of each Myrobolan,\nAnd holy fig-trees wore the look\nOf dancers, as their leaflets shook.\nThe fair Tamála, palm, and pine,\nWith trees that tower and plants that twine,\nThe sweetly varying forms displayed\nOf stately dame or bending maid.\nHere men the foaming winecup quaffed,\nHere drank of milk full many a draught,\nAnd tasted meats of every kind,\nWell dressed, whatever pleased their mind.\nThen beauteous women, seven or eight,\nStood ready by each man to wait:\nBeside the stream his limbs they stripped\nAnd in the cooling water dipped.\nAnd then the fair ones, sparkling eyed,\nWith soft hands rubbed his limbs and dried,\nAnd sitting on the lovely bank\nHeld up the winecup as he drank.\nNor did the grooms forget to feed\nCamel and mule and ox and steed,\nFor there were stores of roasted grain,\nOf honey and of sugar-cane.\nSo fast the wild excitement spread\nAmong the warriors Bharat led,\nThat all the mighty army through\nThe groom no more his charger knew,\nAnd he who drove might seek in vain\nTo tell his elephant again.\nWith every joy and rapture fired,\nEntranced with all the heart desired,\nThe myriads of the host that night\nRevelled delirious with delight.\nUrged by the damsels at their side\nIn wild delight the warriors cried:\n“Ne'er will we seek Ayodhyá, no,\nNor yet to Daṇḍak forest go:\nHere will we stay: may happy fate\nOn Bharat and on Ráma wait.”\nThus cried the army gay and free\nExulting in their lawless glee,\nBoth infantry and those who rode\nOn elephants, or steeds bestrode,\nTen thousand voices shouting, “This\nIs heaven indeed for perfect bliss.”\nWith garlands decked they idly strayed,\nAnd danced and laughed and sang and played.\nAt length as every soldier eyed,\nWith food like Amrit satisfied,\nEach dainty cate and tempting meat,\nNo longer had he care to eat.\nThus soldier, servant, dame, and slave\nReceived whate'er the wish might crave.\nAs each in new-wrought clothes arrayed\nEnjoyed the feast before him laid.\nEach man was seen in white attire\nUnstained by spot or speck of mire:\nNone was athirst or hungry there,\nAnd none had dust upon his hair.\nOn every side in woody dells\nWas milky food in bubbling wells,\nAnd there were all-supplying cows\nAnd honey dropping from the boughs.\nNor wanted lakes of flower-made drink\nWith piles of meat upon the brink,\nBoiled, stewed, and roasted, varied cheer,\nPeachick and jungle-fowl and deer,\nThere was the flesh of kid and boar,\nAnd dainty sauce in endless store,\nWith juice of flowers concocted well,\nAnd soup that charmed the taste and smell,\nAnd pounded fruits of bitter taste,\nAnd many a bath was ready placed\nDown by each river's shelving side\nThere stood great basins well supplied,\nAnd laid therein, of dazzling sheen,\nWhite brushes for the teeth were seen,\nAnd many a covered box wherein\nWas sandal powdered for the skin.\nAnd mirrors bright with constant care,\nAnd piles of new attire were there,\nAnd store of sandals and of shoes,\nThousands of pairs, for all to choose:\nEye-unguents, combs for hair and beard,\nUmbrellas fair and bows appeared.\nLakes gleamed, that lent digestive aid, \nAnd some for pleasant bathing made,\nWith waters fair, and smooth incline\nFor camels, horses, mules, and kine.\nThere saw they barley heaped on high\nThe countless cattle to supply:\nThe golden grain shone fair and bright\nAs sapphires or the lazulite.\nTo all the gathered host it seemed\nAs if that magic scene they dreamed,\nAnd wonder, as they gazed, increased\nAt Bharadvája's glorious feast.\nThus in the hermit's grove they spent\nThat night in joy and merriment,\nBlest as the Gods who take their ease\nUnder the shade of Nandan's trees.\nEach minstrel bade the saint adieu,\nAnd to his blissful mansion flew,\nAnd every stream and heavenly dame\nReturned as swiftly as she came.</code>"

hand in reverence joined to hand,\nWhen fires of worship had been fed,\nHe looked upon the prince and said:\n“O blameless son, I pray thee tell,\nDid the past night content thee well?\nSay if the feast my care supplied\nThy host of followers gratified.”\nHis hands he joined, his head he bent\nAnd spoke in answer reverent\nTo the most high and radiant sage\nWho issued from his hermitage:\n“Well have I passed the night: thy feast\nGave joy to every man and beast;\nAnd I, great lord, and every peer\nWere satisfied with sumptuous cheer,\nThy banquet has delighted all\nFrom highest chief to meanest thrall,\nAnd rich attire and drink and meat\nBanished the thought of toil and heat.\nAnd now, O Hermit good and great,\nA boon of thee I supplicate.\nTo Ráma's side my steps I bend:\nDo thou with friendly eye commend.\nO tell me how to guide my feet\nTo virtuous Ráma's lone retreat:\nGreat Hermit, I entreat thee, say\nHow far from here and which the way.”\nThus by fraternal love inspired\nThe chieftain of the saint inquired:\nThen thus replied the glorious seer\nOf matchless might, of vows austere:\n“Ere the fourth league from here be passed,\nAmid a forest wild and vast,\nStands Chitrakúṭa's mountain tall,\nLovely with wood and waterfall.\nNorth of the mountain thou wilt see\nThe beauteous stream Mandákiní,\nWhere swarm the waterfowl below,\nAnd gay trees on the margin grow.\nThen will a leafy cot between\nThe river and the hill be seen:\n'Tis Ráma's, and the princely pair\nOf brothers live for certain there.\nHence to the south thine army lead,\nAnd then more southward still proceed,\nSo shalt thou find his lone retreat,\nAnd there the son of Raghu meet.”\nSoon as the ordered march they knew,\nThe widows of the monarch flew,\nLeaving their cars, most meet to ride,\nAnd flocked to Bharadvája's side.\nThere with the good Sumitrá Queen\nKauśalyá, sad and worn, was seen,\nCaressing, still with sorrow faint,\nThe feet of that illustrious saint,\nKaikeyí too, her longings crossed,\nReproached of all, her object lost,\nBefore the famous hermit came,\nAnd clasped his feet, o'erwhelmed with shame.\nWith circling steps she humbly went\nAround the saint preëminent,\nAnd stood not far from Bharat's side\nWith heart oppressed, and heavy-eyed.\nThen the great seer, who never broke\nOne holy vow, to Bharat spoke:\n“Speak, Raghu's son: I fain would learn\nThe story of each queen in turn.”\nObedient to the high request\nBy Bharadvája thus addressed,\nHis reverent hands together laid,\nHe, skilled in speech, his answer made:\n“She whom, O Saint, thou seest here\nA Goddess in her form appear,\nWas the chief consort of the king,\nNow worn with fast and sorrowing.\nAs Aditi in days of yore\nThe all-preserving Vishṇu bore,\nKauśalyá bore with happy fate\nLord Ráma of the lion's gait.\nShe who, transfixed with torturing pangs,\nOn her left arm so fondly hangs,\nAs when her withering leaves decay\nDroops by the wood the Cassia spray,\nSumitrá, pained with woe, is she,\nThe consort second of the three:\nTwo princely sons the lady bare,\nFair as the Gods in heaven are fair.\nAnd she, the wicked dame through whom\nMy brothers' lives are wrapped in gloom,\nAnd mourning for his offspring dear,\nThe king has sought his heavenly sphere,—\nProud, foolish-hearted, swift to ire,\nSelf-fancied darling of my sire,\nKaikeyí, most ambitious queen,\nUnlovely with her lovely mien,\nMy mother she, whose impious will\nIs ever bent on deeds of ill,\nIn whom the root and spring I see\nOf all this woe which crushes me.”\nQuick breathing like a furious snake,\nWith tears and sobs the hero spake,\nWith reddened eyes aglow with rage.\nAnd Bharadvája, mighty sage,\nSupreme in wisdom, calm and grave,\nIn words like these good counsel gave:\n“O Bharat, hear the words I say;\nOn her the fault thou must not lay:\nFor many a blessing yet will spring\nFrom banished Ráma's wandering.”\nAnd Bharat, with that promise cheered,\nWent circling round that saint revered,\nHe humbly bade farewell, and then\nGave orders to collect his men.\nPrompt at the summons thousands flew\nTo cars which noble coursers drew,\nBright-gleaming, glorious to behold,\nAdorned with wealth of burnished gold.\nThen female elephants and male,\nGold-girthed, with flags that wooed the gale,\nMarched with their bright bells' tinkling chime\nLike clouds when ends the summer time:\nSome cars were huge and some were light,\nFor heavy draught or rapid flight,\nOf costly price, of every kind,\nWith clouds of infantry behind.\nThe dames, Kauśalyá at their head,\nWere in the noblest chariots led,\nAnd every gentle bosom beat\nWith hope the banished prince to meet.\nThe royal Bharat, glory-crowned,\nWith all his retinue around,\nBorne in a beauteous litter rode,\nLike the young moon and sun that glowed.\nThe army as it streamed along,\nCars, elephants, in endless throng,\nShowed, marching on its southward way,\nLike autumn clouds in long array.</code>"

found\nA cavern in the sloping ground,\nCharming to view, its floor was strown\nWith many a mass of ore and stone,\nIn secret shadow far retired\nWhere gay birds sang with joy inspired,\nAnd trees their graceful branches swayed\nWith loads of blossom downward weighed.\nSoon as he saw the cave which took\nEach living heart and chained the look,\nThus Ráma spoke to Sítá who\nGazed wondering on the silvan view:\n“Does this fair cave beneath the height,\nVidehan lady, charm thy sight?\nThen let us resting here a while\nThe languor of the way beguile.\nThat block of stone so smooth and square\nWas set for thee to rest on there,\nAnd like a thriving Keśar tree\nThis flowery shrub o'ershadows thee.”\nThus Ráma spoke, and Janak's child,\nBy nature ever soft and mild,\nIn tender words which love betrayed\nHer answer to the hero made:\n“O pride of Raghu's children, still\nMy pleasure is to do thy will.\nEnough for me thy wish to know:\nFar hast thou wandered to and fro.”\nThus Sítá spake in gentle tone,\nAnd went obedient to the stone,\nOf perfect face and faultless limb\nPrepared to rest a while with him.\nAnd Ráma, as she thus replied,\nTurned to his spouse again and cried:\n“Thou seest, love, this flowery shade\nFor silvan creatures' pleasure made,\nHow the gum streams from trees and plants\nTorn by the tusks of elephants!\nThrough all the forest clear and high\nResounds the shrill cicala's cry.\nHark how the kite above us moans,\nAnd calls her young in piteous tones;\nSo may my hapless mother be\nStill mourning in her home for me.\nThere mounted on that lofty Sál\nThe loud Bhringráj  repeats his call:\nHow sweetly now he tunes his throat\nResponsive to the Koïl's note.\nOr else the bird that now has sung\nMay be himself the Koïl's young,\nLinked with such winning sweetness are\nThe notes he pours irregular.\nSee, round the blooming Mango clings\nThat creeper with her tender rings,\nSo in thy love, when none is near,\nThine arms are thrown round me, my dear.”\nThus in his joy he cried; and she,\nSweet speaker, on her lover's knee,\nOf faultless limb and perfect face,\nGrew closer to her lord's embrace.\nReclining in her husband's arms,\nA goddess in her wealth of charms,\nShe filled his loving breast anew\nWith mighty joy that thrilled him through.\nHis finger on the rock he laid,\nWhich veins of sanguine ore displayed,\nAnd painted o'er his darling's eyes\nThe holy sign in mineral dyes.\nBright on her brow the metal lay\nLike the young sun's first gleaming ray,\nAnd showed her in her beauty fair\nAs the soft light of morning's air.\nThen from the Keśar's laden tree\nHe picked fair blossoms in his glee,\nAnd as he decked each lovely tress,\nHis heart o'erflowed with happiness.\nSo resting on that rocky seat\nA while they spent in pastime sweet,\nThen onward neath the shady boughs\nWent Ráma with his Maithil spouse.\nShe roaming in the forest shade\nWhere every kind of creature strayed\nObserved a monkey wandering near,\nAnd clung to Ráma's arm in fear.\nThe hero Ráma fondly laced\nHis mighty arms around her waist,\nConsoled his beauty in her dread,\nAnd scared the Monkey till he fled.\nThat holy mark of sanguine ore\nThat gleamed on Sítá's brow before,\nShone by that close embrace impressed\nUpon the hero's ample chest.\nThen Sítá, when the beast who led\nThe monkey troop, afar had fled,\nLaughed loudly in light-hearted glee\nThat mark on Ráma's chest to see.\nA clump of bright Aśokas fired\nThe forest in their bloom attired:\nThe restless blossoms as they gleamed\nA host of threatening monkeys seemed.\nThen Sítá thus to Ráma cried,\nAs longingly the flowers she eyed:\n“Pride of thy race, now let us go\nWhere those Aśoka blossoms grow.”\nHe on his darling's pleasure bent\nWith his fair goddess thither went\nAnd roamed delighted through the wood\nWhere blossoming Aśokas stood,\nAs Śiva with Queen Umá roves\nThrough Himaván's majestic groves.\nBright with purpureal glow the pair\nOf happy lovers sported there,\nAnd each upon the other set\nA flower-inwoven coronet.\nThere many a crown and chain they wove\nOf blooms from that Aśoka grove,\nAnd in their graceful sport the two\nFresh beauty o'er the mountain threw.\nThe lover let his love survey\nEach pleasant spot that round them lay,\nThen turned they to their green retreat\nWhere all was garnished, gay, and neat.\nBy brotherly affection led,\nSumitrá's son to meet them sped,\nAnd showed the labours of the day\nDone while his brother was away.\nThere lay ten black-deer duly slain\nWith arrows pure of poison stain,\nPiled in a mighty heap to dry,\nWith many another carcass nigh.\nAnd Lakshmaṇ's brother saw, o'erjoyed,\nThe work that had his hands employed,\nThen to his consort thus he cried:\n“Now be the general gifts supplied.”\nThen Sítá, fairest beauty, placed\nThe food for living things to taste,\nAnd set before the brothers meat\nAnd honey that the pair might eat.\nThey ate the meal her hands supplied,\nTheir lips with water purified:\nThen Janak's daughter sat at last\nAnd duly made her own repast.\nThe other venison, to be dried,\nPiled up in heaps was set aside,\nAnd Ráma told his wife to stay\nAnd drive the flocking crows away.\nHer husband saw her much distressed\nBy one more bold than all the rest,\nWhose wings where'er he chose could fly,\nNow pierce the earth, now roam the sky.\nThen Ráma laughed to see her stirred\nTo anger by the plaguing bird:\nProud of his love the beauteous dame\nWith burning rage was all aflame.\nNow here, now there, again, again\nShe chased the crow, but all in vain,\nEnraging her, so quick to strike\nWith beak and wing and claw alike:\nThen how the proud lip quivered, how\nThe dark frown marked her angry brow!\nWhen Ráma saw her cheek aglow\nWith passion, he rebuked the crow.\nBut bold in impudence the bird,\nWith no respect for Ráma's word,\nFearless again at Sítá flew:\nThen Ráma's wrath to fury grew.\nThe hero of the mighty arm\nSpoke o'er a shaft the mystic charm,\nLaid the dire weapon on his bow\nAnd launched it at the shameless crow.\nThe bird, empowered by Gods to spring\nThrough earth itself on rapid wing,\nThrough the three worlds in terror fled\nStill followed by that arrow dread.\nWhere'er he flew, now here now there,\nA cloud of weapons filled the air.\nBack to the high-souled prince he fled\nAnd bent at Ráma's feet his head,\nAnd then, as Sítá looked, began\nHis speech in accents of a man:\n“O pardon, and for pity's sake\nSpare, Ráma, spare my life to take!\nWhere'er I turn, where'er I flee,\nNo

troubled Sítá's part,\nAnd furious anger filled my heart.\nThen on the string my arrow lay\nCharmed with a spell thy life to slay.\nThou seekest now my feet, to crave\nForgiveness and thy life to save.\nSo shall thy prayer have due respect:\nThe suppliant I must still protect.\nBut ne'er in vain this dart may flee;\nYield for thy life a part of thee,\nWhat portion of thy body, say,\nShall this mine arrow rend away?\nThus far, O bird, thus far alone\nOn thee my pity may be shown.\nForfeit a part thy life to buy:\n'Tis better so to live than die.”\nThus Ráma spoke: the bird of air\nPondered his speech with anxious care,\nAnd wisely deemed it good to give\nOne of his eyes that he might live.\nTo Raghu's son he made reply:\n“O Ráma, I will yield an eye.\nSo let me in thy grace confide\nAnd live hereafter single-eyed.”\nThen Ráma charged the shaft, and lo,\nFull in the eye it smote the crow.\nAnd the Videhan lady gazed\nUpon the ruined eye amazed.\nThe crow to Ráma humbly bent,\nThen where his fancy led he went.\nRáma with Lakshmaṇ by his side\nWith needful work was occupied.</code>"

flowery branches crowned,\nFainted and fell upon the ground.\nLord of the earth to earth he sank,\nHelpless, as when a towering bank\nWith sudden ruin buries deep\nAn elephant who lay asleep.\nThen swift his wife and brothers flew,\nAnd water, weeping, o'er him threw.\nAs slowly sense and strength he gained,\nFast from his eyes the tears he rained,\nAnd then in accents sad and weak\nKakutstha's son began to speak,\nAnd mourning for the monarch dead,\nWith righteous words to Bharat said:\n“What calls me home, when he, alas,\nHas gone the way which all must pass?\nOf him, the best of kings bereft\nWhat guardian has Ayodhyá left?\nHow may I please his spirit? how\nDelight the high-souled monarch now,\nWho wept for me and went above\nBy me ungraced with mourning love?\nAh, happy brothers! you have paid\nDue offerings to his parting shade.\nE'en when my banishment is o'er,\nBack to my home I go no more,\nTo look upon the widowed state\nReft of her king, disconsolate.\nE'en then, O tamer of the foe,\nIf to Ayodhyá's town I go,\nWho will direct me as of old,\nNow other worlds our father hold?\nFrom whom, my brother, shall I hear\nThose words which ever charmed mine ear\nAnd filled my bosom with delight\nWhene'er he saw me act aright?”\nThus Ráma spoke: then nearer came\nAnd looking on his moonbright dame,\n“Sítá, the king is gone,” he said:\n“And Lakshmaṇ, know thy sire is dead,\nAnd with the Gods on high enrolled:\nThis mournful news has Bharat told.”\nHe spoke: the noble youths with sighs\nRained down the torrents from their eyes.\nAnd then the brothers of the chief\nWith words of comfort soothed his grief:\n“Now to the king our sire who swayed\nThe earth be due libations paid.”\nSoon as the monarch's fate she knew,\nSharp pangs of grief smote Sítá through:\nNor could she look upon her lord\nWith eyes from which the torrents poured.\nAnd Ráma strove with tender care\nTo soothe the weeping dame's despair,\nAnd then, with piercing woe distressed,\nThe mournful Lakshmaṇ thus addressed:\n“Brother, I pray thee bring for me\nThe pressed fruit of the Ingudí,\nAnd a bark mantle fresh and new,\nThat I may pay this offering due.\nFirst of the three shall Sítá go,\nNext thou, and I the last: for so\nMoves the funereal pomp of woe.” \nSumantra of the noble mind,\nGentle and modest, meek and kind,\nWho, follower of each princely youth,\nTo Ráma clung with constant truth,\nNow with the royal brothers' aid\nThe grief of Ráma soothed and stayed,\nAnd lent his arm his lord to guide\nDown to the river's holy side.\nThat lovely stream the heroes found,\nWith woods that ever blossomed crowned,\nAnd there in bitter sorrow bent\nTheir footsteps down the fair descent.\nThen where the stream that swiftly flowed\nA pure pellucid shallow showed,\nThe funeral drops they duly shed,\nAnd “Father, this be thine,” they said.\nBut he, the lord who ruled the land,\nFilled from the stream his hollowed hand,\nAnd turning to the southern side\nStretched out his arm and weeping cried:\n“This sacred water clear and pure,\nAn offering which shall aye endure\nTo thee, O lord of kings, I give:\nAccept it where the spirits live!”\nThen, when the solemn rite was o'er,\nCame Ráma to the river shore,\nAnd offered, with his brothers' aid,\nFresh tribute to his father's shade.\nWith jujube fruit he mixed the seed\nOf Ingudís from moisture freed,\nAnd placed it on a spot o'erspread\nWith sacred grass, and weeping said:\n“Enjoy, great King, the cake which we\nThy children eat and offer thee!\nFor ne'er do blessed Gods refuse\nTo share the food which mortals use.”\nThen Ráma turned him to retrace\nThe path that brought him to the place,\nAnd up the mountain's pleasant side\nWhere lovely lawns lay fair, he hied.\nSoon as his cottage door he gained\nHis brothers to his breast he strained.\nFrom them and Sítá in their woes\nSo loud the cry of weeping rose,\nThat like the roar of lions round\nThe mountain rolled the echoing sound.\nAnd Bharat's army shook with fear\nThe weeping of the chiefs to hear.\n“Bharat,” the soldiers cried, “'tis plain,\nHis brother Ráma meets again,\nAnd with these cries that round us ring\nThey sorrow for their sire the king.”\nThen leaving car and wain behind,\nOne eager thought in every mind,\nSwift toward the weeping, every man,\nAs each could find a passage, ran.\nSome thither bent their eager course\nWith car, and elephant, and horse,\nAnd youthful captains on their feet\nWith longing sped their lord to meet,\nAs though the new-come prince had been\nAn exile for long years unseen.\nEarth beaten in their frantic zeal\nBy clattering hoof and rumbling wheel,\nSent forth a deafening noise as loud\nAs heaven when black with many a cloud.\nThen, with their consorts gathered near,\nWild elephants in sudden fear\nRushed to a distant wood, and shed\nAn odour round them as they fled.\nAnd every silvan thing that dwelt\nWithin those shades the terror felt,\nDeer, lion, tiger, boar and roe,\nBison, wild-cow, and buffalo.\nAnd when the tumult wild they heard,\nWith trembling pinions flew each bird,\nFrom tree, from thicket, and from lake,\nSwan, koïl, curlew, crane, and drake.\nWith men the ground was overspread,\nWith startled birds the sky o'erhead.\nThen on his sacrificial ground\nThe sinless, glorious chief was found.\nLoading with curses deep and loud\nThe hump-back and the queen, the crowd\nWhose cheeks were wet, whose eyes were dim,\nIn fond affection ran to him.\nWhile the big tears their eyes bedewed,\nHe looked upon the multitude,\nAnd then as sire and mother do,\nHis arms about his loved ones threw.\nSome to his feet with reverence pressed,\nSome in his arms he strained:\nEach friend, with kindly words addressed,\nDue share of honour gained.\nThen, by their mighty woe o'ercome,\nThe weeping heroes' cry\nFilled, like the roar of many a drum,\nHill, cavern, earth, and sky.</code>"

fair,\nBut virtue's garb they falsely wear.\nFor he from duty's path who strays\nTo wander in forbidden ways,\nAllured by doctrine false and vain,\nPraise from the good can never gain.\nTheir lives the true and boaster show,\nPure and impure, and high and low,\nElse were no mark to judge between\nStainless and stained and high and mean;\nThey to whose lot fair signs may fall\nWere but as they who lack them all,\nAnd those to virtuous thoughts inclined\nWere but as men of evil mind.\nIf in the sacred name of right\nI do this wrong in duty's spite;\nThe path of virtue meanly quit,\nAnd this polluting sin commit,\nWhat man who marks the bounds between\nVirtue and vice with insight keen,\nWould rank me high in after time\nStained with this soul destroying crime?\nWhither could I, the sinner, turn,\nHow hope a seat in heaven to earn,\nIf I my plighted promise break,\nAnd thus the righteous path forsake?\nThis world of ours is ever led\nTo walk the ways which others tread,\nAnd as their princes they behold,\nThe subjects too their lives will mould.\nThat truth and mercy still must be\nBeloved of kings, is Heaven's decree.\nUpheld by truth the monarch reigns,\nAnd truth the very world sustains.\nTruth evermore has been the love\nOf holy saints and Gods above,\nAnd he whose lips are truthful here\nWins after death the highest sphere.\nAs from a serpent's deadly tooth,\nWe shrink from him who scorns the truth.\nFor holy truth is root and spring\nOf justice and each holy thing,\nA might that every power transcends,\nLinked to high bliss that never ends.\nTruth is all virtue's surest base,\nSupreme in worth and first in place.\nOblations, gifts men offer here,\nVows, sacrifice, and rites austere,\nAnd Holy Writ, on truth depend:\nSo men must still that truth defend.\nTruth, only truth protects the land,\nBy truth unharmed our houses stand;\nNeglect of truth makes men distressed,\nAnd truth in highest heaven is blessed.\nThen how can I, rebellious, break\nCommandments which my father spake—\nI ever true and faithful found,\nAnd by my word of honour bound?\nMy father's bridge of truth shall stand\nUnharmed by my destructive hand:\nNot folly, ignorance, or greed\nMy darkened soul shall thus mislead.\nHave we not heard that God and shade\nTurn from the hated offerings paid\nBy him whose false and fickle mind\nNo pledge can hold, no promise bind?\nTruth is all duty: as the soul,\nIt quickens and supports the whole.\nThe good respect this duty: hence\nIts sacred claims I reverence.\nThe Warrior's duty I despise\nThat seeks the wrong in virtue's guise:\nThose claims I shrink from, which the base,\nCruel, and covetous embrace.\nThe heart conceives the guilty thought,\nThen by the hand the sin is wrought,\nAnd with the pair is leagued a third,\nThe tongue that speaks the lying word.\nFortune and land and name and fame\nTo man's best care have right and claim;\nThe good will aye to truth adhere,\nAnd its high laws must men revere.\nBase were the deed thy lips would teach,\nApproved as best by subtle speech.\nShall I my plighted promise break,\nThat I these woods my home would make?\nShall I, as Bharat's words advise,\nMy father's solemn charge despise?\nFirm stands the oath which then before\nMy father's face I soothly swore,\nWhich Queen Kaikeyí's anxious ear\nRejoiced with highest joy to hear.\nStill in the wood will I remain,\nWith food prescribed my life sustain,\nAnd please with fruit and roots and flowers\nAncestral shades and heavenly powers.\nHere every sense contented, still\nHeeding the bounds of good and ill,\nMy settled course will I pursue,\nFirm in my faith and ever true.\nHere in this wild and far retreat\nWill I my noble task complete;\nAnd Fire and Wind and Moon shall be\nPartakers of its fruit with me.\nA hundred offerings duly wrought\nHis rank o'er Gods for Indra bought,\nAnd mighty saints their heaven secured\nBy torturing years on earth endured.”\nThat scoffing plea the hero spurned,\nAnd thus he spake once more,\nChiding, the while his bosom burned,\nJáváli's impious lore:\n“Justice, and courage ne'er dismayed,\nPity for all distressed,\nTruth, loving honour duly paid\nTo Bráhman, God, and guest—\nIn these, the true and virtuous say,\nShould lives of men be passed:\nThey form the right and happy way\nThat leads to heaven at last.\nMy father's thoughtless act I chide\nThat gave thee honoured place,\nWhose soul, from virtue turned aside,\nIs faithless, dark, and base.\nWe rank the Buddhist with the thief, \nAnd all the impious crew\nWho share his sinful disbelief,\nAnd hate the right and true.\nHence never should wise kings who seek\nTo rule their people well,\nAdmit, before their face to speak,\nThe cursed infidel.\nBut twice-born men in days gone by,\nOf other sort than thou,\nHave wrought good deeds, whose glories high\nAre fresh among us now:\nThis world they conquered, nor in vain\nThey strove to win the skies:\nThe twice-born hence pure lives maintain,\nAnd fires of worship rise.\nThose who in virtue's path delight,\nAnd with the virtuous live,—\nWhose flames of holy zeal are bright,\nWhose hands are swift to give,\nWho injure none, and good and mild\nIn every grace excel,\nWhose lives by sin are undefiled,\nWe love and honour well.”\nThus Ráma spoke in righteous rage\nJáváli's speech to chide,\nWhen thus again the virtuous sage\nIn truthful words replied:\n“The atheist's lore I use no more,\nNot mine his impious creed:\nHis words and doctrine I abhor,\nAssumed at time of need.\nE'en as I rose to speak with thee,\nThe fit occasion came\nThat bade me use the atheist's plea\nTo turn thee from thine aim.\nThe atheist creed I disavow,\nUnsay the words of sin,\nAnd use the faithful's language now\nThy favour, Prince, to win.”</code>"

speech\nThe duties of a wife should teach;\nYet I, O lady, also know\nDue reverence to my lord to show.\nWere he the meanest of the base,\nUnhonoured with a single grace,\nMy husband still I ne'er would leave,\nBut firm through all to him would cleave:\nStill rather to a lord like mine\nWhose virtues high-exalted shine,\nCompassionate, of lofty soul,\nWith every sense in due control,\nTrue in his love, of righteous mind,\nLike a dear sire and mother kind.\nE'en as he ever loves to treat\nKauśalyá with observance meet,\nHas his behaviour ever been\nTo every other honoured queen.\nNay, more, a sonlike reverence shows\nThe noble Ráma e'en to those\nOn whom the king his father set\nHis eyes one moment, to forget.\nDeep in my heart the words are stored,\nSaid by the mother of my lord,\nWhen from my home I turned away\nIn the lone fearful woods to stray.\nThe counsel of my mother deep\nImpressed upon my soul I keep,\nWhen by the fire I took my stand,\nAnd Ráma clasped in his my hand.\nAnd in my bosom cherished yet,\nMy friends' advice I ne'er forget:\nWoman her holiest offering pays\nWhen she her husband's will obeys.\nGood Sávitrí her lord obeyed,\nAnd a high saint in heaven was made,\nAnd for the self-same virtue thou\nHast heaven in thy possession now.\nAnd she with whom no dame could vie,\nNow a bright Goddess in the sky,\nSweet Rohiṇí the Moon's dear Queen,\nWithout her lord is never seen:\nAnd many a faithful wife beside\nFor her pure love is glorified.”\nThus Sítá spake: soft rapture stole\nThrough Anasúyá's saintly soul:\nKisses on Sítá's head she pressed,\nAnd thus the Maithil dame addressed:\n“I by long rites and toils endured\nRich store of merit have secured:\nFrom this my wealth will I bestow\nA blessing ere I let thee go.\nSo right and wise and true each word\nThat from thy lips mine ears have heard,\nI love thee: be my pleasing task\nTo grant the boon that thou shalt ask.”\nThen Sítá marvelled much, and while\nPlayed o'er her lips a gentle smile,\n“All has been done, O Saint,” she cried,\n“And naught remains to wish beside.”\nShe spake; the lady's meek reply\nSwelled Anasúyá's rapture high.\n“Sítá,” she said, “my gift to-day\nThy sweet contentment shall repay.\nAccept this precious robe to wear,\nOf heavenly fabric, rich and rare,\nThese gems thy limbs to ornament,\nThis precious balsam sweet of scent.\nO Maithil dame, this gift of mine\nShall make thy limbs with beauty shine,\nAnd breathing o'er thy frame dispense\nIts pure and lasting influence.\nThis balsam on thy fair limbs spread\nNew radiance on thy lord shall shed,\nAs Lakshmí's beauty lends a grace\nTo Vishṇu's own celestial face.”\nThen Sítá took the gift the dame\nBestowed on her in friendship's name,\nThe balsam, gems, and robe divine,\nAnd garlands wreathed of bloomy twine;\nThen sat her down, with reverence meet,\nAt saintly Anasúyá's feet.\nThe matron rich in rites and vows\nTurned her to Ráma's Maithil spouse,\nAnd questioned thus in turn to hear\nA pleasant tale to charm her ear:\n“Sítá, 'tis said that Raghu's son\nThy hand, mid gathered suitors, won.\nI fain would hear thee, lady, tell\nThe story as it all befell:\nDo thou repeat each thing that passed,\nReviewing all from first to last.”\nThus spake the dame to Sítá: she\nReplying to the devotee,\n“Then, lady, thy attention lend,”\nRehearsed the story to the end:\n“King Janak, just and brave and strong,\nWho loves the right and hates the wrong,\nWell skilled in what the law ordains\nFor Warriors, o'er Videha reigns.\nGuiding one morn the plough, his hand\nMarked out, for rites the sacred land,\nWhen, as the ploughshare cleft the earth,\nChild of the king I leapt to birth.\nThen as the ground he smoothed and cleared,\nHe saw me all with dust besmeared,\nAnd on the new-found babe, amazed\nThe ruler of Videha gazed.\nIn childless love the monarch pressed\nThe welcome infant to his breast:\n“My daughter,” thus he cried, “is she:”\nAnd as his child he cared for me.\nForth from the sky was heard o'erhead\nAs 'twere a human voice that said:\n“Yea, even so: great King, this child\nHenceforth thine own be justly styled.”\nVideha's monarch, virtuous souled,\nRejoiced o'er me with joy untold,\nDelighting in his new-won prize,\nThe darling of his heart and eyes.\nTo his chief queen of saintly mind\nThe precious treasure he consigned,\nAnd by her side she saw me grow,\nNursed with the love which mothers know.\nThen as he saw the seasons fly,\nAnd knew my marriage-time was nigh,\nMy sire was vexed with care, as sad\nAs one who mourns the wealth he had:\n“Scorn on the maiden's sire must wait\nFrom men of high and low estate:\nThe virgin's father all despise,\nThough Indra's peer, who rules the skies.”\nMore near he saw, and still more near,\nThe scorn that filled his soul with fear,\nOn trouble's billowy ocean tossed,\nLike one whose shattered bark is lost.\nMy father knowing how I came,\nNo daughter of a mortal dame,\nIn all the regions failed to see\nA bridegroom meet to match with me.\nEach way with anxious thought he scanned,\nAnd thus at length the monarch planned:\n“The Bride's Election will I hold,\nWith every rite prescribed of old.”\nIt pleased King Varuṇ to bestow\nQuiver and shafts and heavenly bow\nUpon my father's sire who reigned,\nWhen Daksha his great rite ordained.\nWhere was the man might bend or lift\nWith utmost toil that wondrous gift?\nNot e'en in dreams could mortal king\nStrain the great bow or draw the string.\nOf this tremendous bow possessed,\nMy truthful father thus addressed\nThe lords of many a region, all\nAssembled at the monarch's call:\n“Whoe'er this bow can manage, he\nThe husband of my child shall be.”\nThe suitors viewed with hopeless eyes\nThat wondrous bow of mountain size,\nThen to my sire they bade adieu,\nAnd all with humbled hearts withdrew.\nAt length with Viśvámitra came\nThis son of Raghu, dear to fame,\nThe royal sacrifice to view.\nNear to my father's home he drew,\nHis brother Lakshmaṇ by his side,\nRáma, in deeds heroic tried.\nMy sire with honour entertained\nThe saint in lore of duty trained,\nWho thus in turn addressed the king:\n“Ráma and Lakshmaṇ here who spring\nFrom royal Daśaratha, long\nTo see thy bow so passing strong.”\nBefore the prince's eyes was laid\nThat marvel, as the Bráhman prayed.\nOne moment on the bow he gazed,\nQuick to the notch the string he raised,\nThen, in the wandering people's view,\nThe cord with mighty force he drew.\nThen with an awful crash as loud\nAs thunderbolts that cleave the cloud,\nThe bow beneath the matchless strain\nOf arms heroic snapped in twain.\nThus, giving purest water, he,\nMy sire, to Ráma offered me.\nThe prince the offered gift declined\nTill he should learn his father's mind;\nSo horsemen swift Ayodhyá sought\nAnd back her aged monarch brought.\nMe then my sire to Ráma gave,\nSelf-ruled, the bravest of the brave.\nAnd Urmilá, the next to me,\nGraced with all gifts, most fair to see,\nMy sire with Raghu's house allied,\nAnd gave her to be Lakshmaṇ's bride.\nThus from the princes of the land\nLord Ráma won my maiden hand,\nAnd him exalted high above\nHeroic chiefs I truly love.”</code>"
